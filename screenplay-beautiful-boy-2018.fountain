INT. MEDICAL OFFICE AT UCLA - DAY

DAVID SHEFF - in his 40's and still a great looking guy - is
seated with DR. BROWN (62), a passionate amiable man.

We stay close on David.

DR BROWN (O.S.)
So this is for The New York Times Magazine?

DAVID
No. I'm sorry... I freelance, I write for different magazines but this is a personal matter.

DR BROWN (O.S.)
A personal matter?

DAVID
Yes. I'm sorry, is that okay?

DR BROWN (O.S.)
That's absolutely okay. May I ask what this is regarding?

DAVID
It's about my son.

DR BROWN (O.S.)
Okay how can I help?

DAVID
There are moments that I look at him, this kid that I raised who I thought that I knew inside and out, and I wonder who he is? He's been doing all sorts of drugs, but he's addicted to crystal meth, which seems to be the worst of all of them. And I guess I am here because I just want to know all that I can about all of it. Know your enemies right? So... my two big questions are, what is it doing to him and what can I do to help him?

FADE TO BLACK.

**TEXT ON SCREEN:** one year earlier

FADE IN:

===

INT. UPSTAIRS HALLWAY, SHEFF HOUSE - NIGHT

David is walking in the hallway and peeks inside his son
NIC's (18) room. The bed is made, Nic is not there. David
turns off the light and closes the door.

INT. BEDROOM, SHEFF HOUSE - NIGHT

David can't sleep. He looks at the clock, it's 1 am. Silently
he gets out of bed to not wake his wife.

INT. UPSTAIRS HALLWAY, SHEFF HOUSE - NIGHT

Restless, David walks downstairs.

EXT. SHEFF HOUSE - NIGHT

From the surrounding woods, we see a light on the first floor
turn on.

INT. DAVID'S STUDY, SHEFF HOUSE - DAY

David is on the phone in his workspace. It's ringing.

HOSPITAL FRONT DESK (O.S.)
Marin General Hospital, how may I
help you?

David's study is the kind of space you'd love to live a
creative life. David is a senior writer for Rolling Stone,
Playboy, Wired, Vanity Fair. On the walls, artwork mixed with
family photos - Nic at various ages - mixed with framed
magazine covers, including David's own holy grail, the
Playboy-cover featuring John Lennon's final interview from
1980.

DAVID
Hi, my son went missing and I
wanted to check if he was maybe
brought in. Maybe an accident
happened or...

HOSPITAL FRONT DESK (O.S.)
Can I have name and a description,
sir?

DAVID
Nicholas Sheff. S-H-E-F-F. He's 18
years old, just over six feet tall.
About 130 pounds.
(MORE)

===

DAVID (CONT'D)
Maybe less, I'm not sure. He has
shoulder length brown hair and
green eyes.

HOSPITAL FRONT DESK (O.S.)
Thank you, please hold.

DAVID
Okay.

As he waits it is excruciating. He looks around the room. At
the old photos of Nic. It takes forever.

HOSPITAL FRONT DESK (O.S.)
Mr. Sheff?

DAVID
Yes.


HOSPITAL FRONT DESK (O.S.)
There is no one by that name, sir.

DAVID
Okay. Thank you.

David hangs up.

INT. NIC'S BEDROOM, SHEFF HOUSE - NIGHT

David enters Nic's room. Turns on the light. What is he
looking for? He doesn't really know.

A little nervous he goes through some stuff, opens the
drawers and checks them.

He sits at Nic's desk and studies his drawings and writing
tacked to the wall.

On Nic's desk he sees a couple of books. He takes one, 'The
Beautiful And The Damned', by Fitzgerald. He takes the book
and flips it open at some random places, reads snippets here
and there.

EXT. BACK YARD, SHEFF HOUSE - DAY

David is walking around with his phone in the garden.

DAVID
He...
(a beat)
He's been gone for two days.

===

He is speaking to VICKI, Nic's mom.

They separated a long time ago, and Vicki is always a little
uneasy when confronted with David.

VICKI (O.S.)
What?! What do you mean, he's gone?
What's going on?

DAVID
Well, I don't know.

VICKI (O.S.)
Two days? Why didn't you tell me
sooner?

DAVID
I didn't want to worry you I guess.
I just-

VICKI (O.S.)
I'm his mother, David.
(a beat)
Didn't you see this coming?

DAVID
Uh, no.

VICKI (O.S.)
What?

DAVID
(a little upset)
No. I didn't see it coming.
(even more)
If I had seen it coming I would
have done something.

VICKI (O.S.)
It was just a question David. You,
know I haven't been talking a lot
with him lately.

In a split-second this conversation has turned into a fight,
as many times before, probably.

DAVID
Well, maybe that's why you
shouldn't be giving me advice on
parenting, right? Fuck, Vicki.
Could we just not blame each other
right now? Thanks.

===

VICKI
Who's blaming who here? If I hardly
ever see him, it's because he's
supposed to come to LA for the
holidays, but always finds a reason
not to come.


DAVID
Well that's not my fault, is it?

They both hang up.

David watches his wife KAREN through the windows of her
studio. She is the mother of their 2 younger kids, JASPER (7)
and DAISY (5), and the stepmother of Nic. Together they also
have two dogs, BRUTUS and MOONDOG.

She is a beautiful and artistic woman, self assured and a
little neurotic at the same time. She's wearing a colorful
paint stained overall.

Karen notices David, they look at each other. Karen stops
painting and walks to David. They hug.

INT. HOSPITAL ROOM - DAY (FLASHBACK)

A younger David hands Nic (12) little wrapped-in- BABY
JASPER. Nic stares at his little brother. A younger Karen
watches Nic and Jasper.

DAVID
Nic. Here's your brother.

NIC
Hi Jasper. This is amazing, dad.

Nic touches Jasper's little hands. Karen and David watch
them.

CUT TO:

David takes his jacket. He and Nic have to go. Karen and Nic
hug and say goodbye.

KAREN
Bye mister. I'll miss you this
summer. Write me.

NIC
Write me back.

KAREN
And work on your french.

===

NIC
Oui madame.

A little laugh.

INT. DEPARTURES, SF AIRPORT - DAY (FLASHBACK CONTINUED)

David and Nic are in the departures hall, among other MINORS
that will fly unaccompanied and their PARENTS, dropping them
off. The minors are wearing pink paper badges with names
written in Magic Marker. A couple of FLIGHT ATTENDANTS usher
the kids to board the plane.

DAVID
Have a great summer. Say hi to your
Mom.

David is a little nervous. He kisses Nic on the forehead.
They hug.

DAVID (CONT'D)
Everything.

NIC
Everything.

CUT TO:
David watches through the glass, as the plane pulls back. He
looks sadder than before. (he was putting on a show for Nic)
The plane takes off. David walks away.

I/E. FAMILY CAR / ROADS TO INVERNESS/ DRIVEWAY, SHEFF HOUSE DAY

Present time.

David is driving the family car, the kids are in the back.

David watches them being goofy but his mind is somewhere
else.

They come home, David sees a Volvo parked on the driveway.

He parks behind it, gets out and takes a closer look at the
Volvo. Nobody in the car. The front headlight is cracked.

Daisy and Jasper get out of the car too, but don't notice the
car being home as something special.

They enter the house.

===

**INT. UPSTAIRS HALLWAY, SHEFF HOUSE - DAY**

David approaches Nic's bedroom door. It's closed. He opens
it.

**INT. NIC'S BEDROOM, SHEFF HOUSE - DAY**

David sees Nic curled up in his bed. A moment of relief. He
watches him, goes nearby, sits down next to him. Nic looks
pretty bad. He's shivering.

DAVID
Hey. Where have you been?

Nic opens his eyes.

NIC
I just need to sleep.

DAVID
What have you been doing?

NIC
I just need to sleep, alright?
Leave me alone.

David notices Jasper and Daisy standing in the door and
watching. They see Nic who looks really wasted.

DAVID
Guys, could you go downstairs? I'll
be there in a minute.

They hesitate a little, want to see what is going on.

DAVID (CONT'D)
Please.

They back off. David looks at Nic again, his eyes are closed
again. Nic is calmer now.

David looks at him for a moment...

**I/E. VOLVO / INVERNESS ROADS - DAY**

A tiny Volvo in a wide landscape. The car drives towards us.
David is driving.

Nic feels sick. David pulls over. We stay close on David.

From outside the car we hear the sounds of throwing up.

===

Nic reenters the car. David gently rubs his back.

INT. VOLVO / GOLDEN GATE BRIDGE - DAY

David and Nic are driving. Nic watches the road and the
clouds. He still feels sick. They cross the Golden Gate
bridge.

INT. VOLVO / ENTERING SAN FRANCISCO - DAY

David and Nic enter San Francisco, they drive up a typical
steep hill.

I/E. VOLVO / OHLHOFF REHAB - DAY

They arrive at a driveway to the rehab centre. David parks.

NIC
Dad I'm sorry. I fucked up and it
was a mistake but it was a one time
mistake. I learned my lesson. I
don't want to go through this shit
again.

David looks at Nic, feels for him.

DAVID
Let's just go inside.

NIC
No.

DAVID
They are professionals. Let's just
listen to what they have to say.

In a split-second Nic just changes and becomes angry and
aggressive. He screams out of frustration.

NIC
Look I'm 18! You can't force me.

David is taken aback. Nic's right, he no longer has a legal
right to force Nic into rehab.

DAVID
This got out of hand, right? Don't
you think? Come on.

NIC
Okay. I'm doing it for you.

===

He looks at David one more time and exits the car.

EXT. OHLHOFF REHAB - DAY

They walk towards the building. SOME GUYS - presumable
addicts or ex-addicts - are smoking on the stairs leading to
the entrance. Nic looks at them. They look back.

INT. WAITING ROOM, OHLHOFF REHAB - DAY

Nic sits in an austere waiting room.

INT. ADMISSIONS OFFICE, OHLHOFF REHAB - DAY

David is seated with the DIRECTOR of the program, an imposing
woman.

DIRECTOR

He needs treatment and fast. There
are still a lot of drugs in his
system and worst of all, he is in
denial.

David is watching Nic through the glass of the door.

DAVID
Can you help him?

DIRECTOR
Oh yeah. A lot of the people here
are not here by choice and they
have just as much a chance as
anybody.

DAVID
OK.


Although all of this is alarming, David stays cool. 'We will
fix this'.

DIRECTOR
We have one free bed, so if you
want I can check him in for our 28
day treatment. Then we evaluate.

DAVID
Um. What is your success rate?

DIRECTOR
On the high end, 80 percent. On the
low end 25 percent?

===

David nods.

DIRECTOR (CONT'D)
Look, he will have daily
consultations with staff physicians
and a psychiatrist. We have daily
AA and NA meetings. He'll be
monitored very closely, ok?

David thinks, nods.

CUT TO:

Papers need to be filled in / Social security numbers /
Credit card information / Nic enters, he needs to sign too.

CUT TO:

David takes Nic in his arms, looks him straight in the eyes:

DAVID
Everything.

Clearly some reference loaded with history - though we don't
know what it means.

Nic looks at David. A little grumpy, ashamed too.

NIC
Everything.

Nic looks away, and walks off with a NURSE. The director and
David watch them walk away.

INT. DINING ROOM, OHLHOFF REHAB - MORNING

Nic, in PJ's, looking really bad and down, steps into the
rehab dining room and kitchen. 15 or so other Ohlhoff CLIENTS
are serving themselves breakfast. All kinds of different
people. Men, boys, women, girls. Some look as down as Nic,
others are pretty up. It's a mixed atmosphere.

Nic sits at a table and pours himself a glass of orange
juice. He takes a sip and looks up at the man eating next to
him, JOHNNY, 40-ish, who has lost most of his teeth.
Nic studies him and then looks back down.

DAVID (PRE-LAP)
Why are you always in this room?
You hardly ever come out of here.
It's like you're a vampire.

===

**INT. NIC'S BEDROOM, SHEFF HOUSE - DAY (FLASHBACK)**

Nic is on the floor writing in his notebook.

NIC
I read. I draw.

David is standing at Nic's desk.

DAVID
You know what we should do? We
should go surfing.

Nic looks up from his notebook and smiles at David.

NIC
Yeah?

DAVID
Does that sound good?

NIC
Yeah, well. I'm into other things
now.

DAVID
Reading misanthropes and seriously
depressed writers...

NIC
Ah, cmon. They're kinda great
though, right?

David smiles, he is reminded of his own young years.

DAVID
I get it. It'll pass, though.

Silence.

DAVID (CONT'D)
It always does.

Nic looks back down at his notebook.

NIC
What does?

DAVID
The feeling of being alienated and
isolated.

Nic chuckles.

===

NIC
That really helps. Thanks for the
advice.

David understands Nic wants to be alone.

DAVID
OK.

He exits Nic's room.

NIC
Sorry, dad, that was stupid. It
came out wrong, I'm sorry.

A little smile. He closes the door.

**INT. OFFICE, OHLHOFF - DAY**

Present time.

David and Karen sit with the director.

The door opens. VINCE - one of the Ohlhoff counselors - and
Nic enter. He looks a little better.

DAVID
Hey.

NIC
Hi dad.

David and Karen stand up and hug Nic. It's a little awkward.
Vince takes some chairs, they all have a seat. Vince starts
talking to break the ice.

VINCE
So, we feel he's made great
progress. Right Nic?

NIC
Yes.

DAVID
That's great.

KAREN
That's great, Nic.

David pats Nic on the shoulder and leaves his hand there.

===

VINCE
So we should maybe talk about the
coming weeks. Nic?

NIC
Yes.

David is surprised: where is this leading to? Nic takes a
moment, then turns to David and Karen.

NIC (CONT'D)
I think I need a little bit more
time in rehab. So if it was alright
with you guys I was wondering if I
could stay in the halfway house
here.

David and Karen look to Vince.

VINCE
The halfway house is an open living
facility, with follow-up every
night. And we would help him find a
job.

A beat. David is trying to figure out what this means... He
looks at Nic.

NIC
I don't want to go to college right
now, dad.

David didn't see this one coming, doesn't understand. Takes
his time to let it sink in.

DAVID
Oh. OK. And do what?

NIC
(takes his time, soft)
I think I need to be independent.
Dad, I'm telling you this is...
it's going to be good.

David doesn't know what to say. A long silence.

INT. VOLVO - DAY

David is angry. He and Karen sit in the front.

DAVID
What is he gonna do? Make coffees
the rest of his life?

===

Outside a strong wind plays with the branches of the trees
aligning the street.

KAREN
Frederic told me they have friends
that have a son who did a 4 week
program, but it wasn't enough. He's
doing a year program now.

David thinks about it... Knows she's right, but can't admit
it.

DAVID
(stung)
I wish you wouldn't talk to
everybody about it.

KAREN
What's that got to do with it?

DAVID
To protect Nic you know.  At some
point he's gonna want to get on
with his life, and maybe it's best
that not everybody knows about
this.

Karen thinks about it, OK, point taken.

KAREN
OK.
But can we not make this about me?
(back to the issue at
hand)
Look, Nic needs some more time. And
that's fine. OK?

David nods.
DAVID
OK.

KAREN
OK?

DAVID
Yeah. OK.

He takes her hand. A beat. She lays her hand on his hand.

===

**EXT. BACK YARD, SHEFF HOUSE - DAY**

In the backyard Karen is body painting Daisy as an Indian.
Jasper is running around in red socks and red underpants and
already bodypainted as SPIDERMAN.

**INT. KITCHEN, SHEFF HOUSE - DAY**

David is preparing food. The phone rings, and immediately the
dogs start barking very loud. David, a bit annoyed, looks
around but cannot find the portable phone, so it keeps on
ringing, and the dogs keep on barking. Finally he finds the
phone and answers.

DAVID
David Sheff.

One last bark by Moondog.

DAVID (CONT'D)
Shhht.

DIRECTOR (O.S.)
Hi Mr. Sheff. This is Annie
Goldblum from the Ohlhoff Center.

DAVID
Oh, yes. Hi, hello.

DIRECTOR (O.S.)
I'm sorry to disturb you, but I
need to inform you about Nic.

DAVID
OK?

DIRECTOR (O.S.)
He left the facility today, during
some free time, and he has not
returned since.

DAVID
Oh no.

DIRECTOR (O.S.)
I'm sorry Mr. Sheff. But please
don't despair, this happens.

DAVID
But, I thought you said he was
doing so well?

===

DIRECTOR (O.S.)
You should think of this as part of
the process. Relapse is a part of
recovery.

DAVID
Relapse is part of recovery?

DIRECTOR (O.S.)
It's part of Nic's learning
process.

DAVID
That's... that's like saying
crashing is part of pilot training.

DIRECTOR (O.S.)
Look, he'll be back. Probably
really quick.

DAVID
Is somebody out looking for him?

DIRECTOR (O.S.)
It's not our responsibility once he
leaves the facility. But he's
welcome to come back.

Of course. David hangs up angry. He watches the rest of his
family outside for a while, who are still oblivious.

CUT TO:

**I/E. VOLVO / PARKING AND ALLEYWAYS, SAN RAFAEL - DAY**

David is driving through San Rafael. The rain is pouring
down. David has opened his window and is looking left and
right, then turns and drives up on a parking lot...

INTERCUT WITH:

**E/I. ROADS NEAR THE OCEAN/ VOLVO - DAY (FLASHBACK)**

Younger David is driving with younger Nic.

The intro to “Territorial Pissings” by Nirvana is playing:
very wild drums, very wild guitar.

Nic knows it by heart and shouts along.

KURT COBAIN + NIC
*When I was an alien... !!!*

===

David watches Nic, it's funny.

Nic continues to head-bang and scream along with the song.
It's really wild. David is having fun, Nic too... (although
he's screaming along so wild, it becomes a little scary).

E/I. MIDDLE SCHOOL / VOLVO - DAY (FLASHBACK CONT'D)

The song continues over young people exiting middle school.
David is waiting near his Volvo for Nic. Surfboards in the
back of the car. David spots Nic. 12-year-old Nic looks like
a typical nineties teen: grungy, a Primus T-shirt that is way
too big, long hair covering his eyes, some pimples.

Nic stands out, because the guys who are walking next to him
all seem just a little older, they all have short hair,
everybody is dressed the same.

BACK TO:

**I/E. VOLVO / PARKING AND ALLEYWAYS, SAN RAFAEL - DAY**

David pulls up to a KITCHEN HELP smoking outside at the back
door of a restaurant under an umbrella. The music softens.

DAVID
Excuse me, have you seen a kid
hanging around here?

The guy shakes his head.

DAVID (CONT'D)
No? OK. Thank you.

David closes his window. He can't see a lot because of the
rain. He drives towards an alley.

CUT TO:

E/I. MIDDLE SCHOOL / VOLVO - DAY (FLASHBACK CONT'D)

Nic and David walk through the parking lot. Nirvana now
blaring, drowning out their conversation so we can't hear.

DAVID
Hey... how 'd it go?

NIC
OK, I guess.

===

DAVID
Yeah? Tell me.

NIC
Well, just different compared to
San Francisco. The kids there were
more into drawing and art and
reading and stuff. It's not really
cool here to be smart. But that's
ok. I'll just get worse grades.

David laughs as they get into the car.

BACK TO:

I/E. VOLVO / PARKING AND ALLEYWAYS, SAN RAFAEL - DAY

David looks left and right, then slows down as he sees a
shape appear.

It's Nic. He's in jeans and T-shirt and is soaking wet. He
looks bad, has bruises on his face.

David walks over to Nic and when he reaches him, Nic almost
goes limp in David's arms. He half carries him, opens the
passenger door, drops him in the seat, closes the door.

David gets in at the other side, looks at Nic for a moment he's shivering, almost passed out. What to do, what to say?
Nic turns and vomits, soiling himself and the seat.
The music STOPS.

CUT TO:

INT. CAR/ GROCERY STORE - DAY (FLASHBACK)

David and late teen's Nic just got some groceries in the
local grocery store. The atmosphere is good, Nic's talking
freely, David is enjoying. David is about to start the car,
and reverse...

NIC
Hey dad, do you want to smoke this?

Nic takes out a joint.

DAVID
Hey! Woah, wait. What? Stop.

David nervously laughs.

===

DAVID (CONT'D)
Put that away.

NIC
I think we should smoke this
together.

Nic keeps eyeing David.

DAVID
This is crazy. No.

NIC
I know you smoke.

DAVID
Yeah... No, no...

NIC
You know what? You're right, I'll
just light it here alone.

Nic doesn't get a yes or a no, as David is too surprised, so
Nic puts it to his lips and takes out a lighter.

DAVID
Don't! Stop it. Occasionally from
time to time I will have a hit or
two at a party but it has been
awhile...

NIC
Just have a celebratory joint with
your son.

They laugh and David starts the car, backs up.

DAVID
Oh, god. Come on.

EXT. ROAD LEADING TO POINT REYES LIGHTHOUSE - DAY (FLASHBACK CONTINUED)

The car is parked at a road with a spectacular view over the
ocean and magnificent windswept trees. They sit on the hood
of the car. Sunset. Nic takes a hit from the joint...

DAVID
You're amazing, Nic. You applied to
6 colleges and were accepted to all
of them! Stop doubting yourself?
Look at you. Gimme that.

===

Passes it to David. He takes a couple of hits. Nic laughs.

DAVID (CONT'D)
What?

NIC
That was a nice hit.

David exhales and they laugh together. He hands the joint
back to Nic.

NIC (CONT'D)
Thank you, this is nice... thing to
do.
(intrigued, asking something he never asked before)
You did a lot of drugs, right?

DAVID
I did my share. Sure. I
experimented with different kinds
of drugs. And had fun sometimes. I
did.

David chuckles.

DAVID (CONT'D)
But not harmless, I had a friend
that...

NIC
Is this the lecture part?

It makes David smile.

NIC (CONT'D)
You worry too much. Everyone does
it.

DAVID
Yeah, well... Just be careful.

NIC
It's just pot. It's just once in a
while. I'm just partying a little.
I worked hard this year... I
deserve to party a little now.

Nic is laughing, a bit stoned. David watches Nic with a
smile. He's also a bit stoned, we notice now.

DAVID
Deserve to party...

===

Nic takes a last hit of the joint, throws the butt away.

NIC
It just takes the edge off things,
you know. Of stupid all day
reality.

David thinks about this. All of a sudden changes his
attitude. Instead of the pot-smoking buddy, he's the worrying
father again (but also, slightly stoned).

DAVID
What is stupid about reality?

Nic looks at David, wants to argue...

NIC
Well you know, like daily stupid
things, that don't matter...

DAVID
Come on Nic, you cannot say dumb
shit like that or you'll start
believing it.

INT. DAVID'S STUDY, SHEFF HOUSE - DAY

Back to present time.

David is at his computer. He's pulling up websites, gathering
information, writing.

On the screen: “Crystal meth - is a very addictive stimulant
drug...”

Another website: “Meth can make a person's mood change
quickly. For example, someone using meth might become angry
and violent.”

David stops writing. He stares at the computer. He looks
exhausted.

INT. NIC'S BEDROOM, ST. CELINE REHAB - DAY

Nic enters his bedroom followed by David and Karen. It's a
simple, clean, white room with twin single beds and nightstands. David and Karen look around. Nic puts down a pile of
folded clothes in a laundry bag.

NIC
Thanks for bringing this, Karen.

===

Nic puts up his arms.

NIC (CONT'D)
This is my home.

David looks at Nic, then looks out of the window, vineyard
view. Karen notices an 'Alcoholics Anonymous Big Book' on
Nic's bedside table.

CUT TO:

David and Nic sit on the beds and face each other. David
watches Nic for a moment.

DAVID
A couple of weeks ago you told me
that you had only done crystal meth
once but the story has to be bigger
than that, right?

Nic nods.

DAVID (CONT'D)
There's more to it?

David's mood changes.

DAVID (CONT'D)
(firm)
Yeah?

KAREN
David.

DAVID
We need to know.

A beat. Nic is thinking, where to start?

NIC
I think I always liked it.

DAVID
What?

NIC
Anything.


Karen takes a seat next to Nic on the bed. He's opening up.

NIC (CONT'D)
Pot. Alcohol. Ecstasy. Cocaine.
LSD.

===

A beat.

DAVID
And you've been doing all that, for
what, years?

NIC
A couple of years, yeah.

DAVID
And crystal meth?

NIC
Just a couple months.

DAVID
But why?

NIC
I don't know... When I tried it, I
felt, I felt better than I ever
had... So I kept on doing it.

DAVID
I was worried that you were smoking
too much pot meanwhile you're out
doing every drug on the planet?

Nic doesn't know what to answer. David is coming a little too
strong at him. David goes on.

DAVID (CONT'D)
And hiding it and lying. And why?
Tell me.

NIC
I don't know.

DAVID
Why? Tell me why!

KAREN
Ease up.

NIC
I don't know!

Nic starts crying. Karen is comforting Nic.

DAVID
I thought we were close. Closer
than most fathers and sons.

Nic tries to defend himself...

===

NIC
I feel like you're just always
disappointed in me. You're
disappointed I don't go to college,
you're...

...but this makes David really angry.

DAVID
Well can you blame me? Not too long
ago you were reading and you were
writing and you were on the
waterpolo team. And look at us now!
This isn't us. This is not who we
are!

KAREN
Guys, please stop this. Dave, calm
down! Stop it.

Nic starts sobbing.

David does calm down. He takes a moment to reset himself.

Silence.

NIC
Dad, I'm really sorry about
everything.

Another silence.

NIC (CONT'D)
I'm really sorry, dad.

DAVID
Nic, what you have you are going to
find it again. You're going to get
it back.

Nic looks up. They look at each other. David takes Nic half
in his arms. Nic lets it happen. Karen takes Nic's hand,
strokes it.

EXT. BACK YARD, SHEFF HOUSE - DAY

David sits in the yard playing catch with the dogs but his
mind is clearly somewhere else.

EXT. REMOTE BEACH - LATE AFTERNOON (FLASHBACK)

David and Nic paddle out into the ocean with surfboards into
a pretty wild ocean. It's a bit foggy.

===

In the distance we see rocks and big cliffs.

Nic paddles away as David gets hit by a big wave. David
struggles to get back onto his board and starts paddling as
fast as he can, but gets hit by another big wave. He gets
thrown towards the beach.

A bit out of breath, David stands up and grabs his board. He
watches over the ocean. We see his POV: big breaking waves,
no Nic. David panics a little. He looks left and right.

DAVID
Nic? Nic?!

In the distance we see a surfboard? Or something? A wave
crashes onto it. David steps further into the ocean, kneedeep, waist-deep, holding his surfboard, challenging big
walls of whitewater coming in. More panic.

David starts paddling again. Again paddling hard, fighting
against the waves coming in.

DAVID (CONT'D)
Fuck.


Finally he paddles and gets behind the point where the wave
breaks. He sighs. Looks around again, still breathing hard.

Meanwhile it's darker, and there's more fog. He pushes
himself up his board to try and spot Nic again.

And all of a sudden there is Nic, standing atop a wave, and
carving up and down. Coming into David's direction and
hooting for joy.

NIC
Woo-hoo!

David watches Nic. Wow, he looks amazing.

INT. DINING ROOM, OHLHOFF REHAB - NIGHT

Back to the present.

Nic on his cell phone.

NIC
Hey dad. How's New York?

DAVID (O.S.)
Fine. Good interview today. How are
you?

===

NIC
Oh I'm doing good.

Nic fidgets with a glass of water.

CUT TO:

INT. AMBASSADOR HOTEL - NIGHT - CONTINUOUS

David is sitting in a fancy hotel room on the other end of
the phone.

DAVID
Yeah? You sure?

David stands. He paces.

NIC (O.S.)
Yes I am.. It's just... Uhm...

DAVID
What's going on?

David becomes a little nervous. He stares through the large
window overlooking the NY skyline.

NIC (O.S.)
We had this great group session and
one of the guys here was saying he
would do anything for a chance to
go to college but he can't.

DAVID
OK.

NIC
And we were talking later and he
said you can still go to college.
Don't be an idiot. Go to college.
David walks up to the window.

INTERCUT BETWEEN DAVID AND NIC FROM HERE ON

NIC (CONT'D)
I don't know. It's just crazy. I
realized I don't think I should
stay behind. I love writing and I
feel like I'm good at it and I do
it a lot but obviously there's
still a lot for me to learn.

David smiles.

===

NIC (CONT'D)
Anyway, I would love to give it a
go... if it's alright with you
guys.

A beat. We see David's excitement reflected in the window,
which he doesn't express audibly to Nic.

DAVID
Yeah. I'll talk to Karen. And to
your mom.

INT. PLANE - DAY
Nic takes a seat in a crowded plane. David stands in the
aisle, looks at his boarding pass.

DAVID
Oh, I'm further down. I'll ask to
switch.

A STEWARD comes by in a rush, closing the overhead bins.

NIC
I'll be fine.

David walks further and takes his seat. Nic waves and smiles.
David smiles back and settles in his seat.

Between the seats he sees Nic, he watches him for a while, he
looks way better. Nic is talking enthusiastically to the
person next to him.

INT. NIC'S BEDROOM, EAST HAMPSHIRE COLLEGE - DAY

Nic is getting settled in his room, unpacking. In the HALLWAY
we sense other FRESHMEN KIDS and their FAMILIES. David sits
at a desk, takes the space in, looks at Nic. Silence for a
while. Nic sits at the other desk.

DAVID
Have you met your roommate yet?

NIC
Yeah, he seems nice. He was just in
the hall.

DAVID
I feel for you, though.

David is looking through a stack of CD's. We notice George
Michael, Celine Dion, Steve Miller Band.

===

DAVID (CONT'D)
Ouch.


They both laugh.

NIC
No worries, I'll educate him.
Before you know it he'll be
listening to John Zorn.

David puts the CD's back.

DAVID
You know, I better get going.

David gets up. They look at each other for a moment. Big
moment. They hug.

NIC
Everything.

DAVID
Everything.

MUSIC RISES
David walks out.

EXT. EAST HAMPSHIRE COLLEGE GROUNDS - DAY

Nic - backpack over his shoulders - is gliding on a
skateboard across the lovely campus grounds. Pale autumn
sunlight. He seems carefree and confident.

INT. TUTORIAL ROOM, EAST HAMPSHIRE COLLEGE - MONTAGE

20 STUDENTS (19, 20) and a PROFESSOR (woman, 40) around a
table. Nic is a little shy amidst all these new people.

NIC
So, this is a poem by Charles
Bukowski. This man saved my life
multiple times.

Some laugh. As Nic begins to read


INTERCUT WITH:

===

INT. ROLLING STONE MAGAZINE - MEETING ROOM - DAY

David in a meeting room talking and laughing with a couple of
editors.

NIC (O.S.)
*I changed jobs and cities,
I hated holidays, babies...*

EXT. BACK YARD, SHEFF HOUSE - DAY

Karen painting a tree in their garden in very uplifting
colors.

NIC (O.S.)
*History, newspapers, museums...*

INT. TUTORIAL ROOM, EAST HAMPSHIRE COLLEGE

Eyes on Nic as he continues.

NIC
*Grandmothers, marriage, movies,
spiders...*

EXT. BACK YARD, SHEFF HOUSE - DAY

The kids and David throwing balloons with paint towards a
canvas. With every word of the poem another balloon splash.

NIC (O.S.)
*Garbagemen, English accents, Spain,
France, Italy, walnuts, and the
color of range.*

Karen joins in on the family fun.

BACK TO:

INT. TUTORIAL ROOM, EAST HAMPSHIRE COLLEGE

People are listening, sometimes chuckling. JULIA (18, a sweet
girl) thinks Nic is cool. Nic notices, goes on.

NIC
*Algebra angered me, opera sickened
me, Charlie Chaplin was a
fake and flowers were for
pansies.*

===

EXT. EAST HAMPSHIRE COLLEGE GROUNDS - DAY

Nic and Julia sit on the lawn, they're talking, Nic is wildly
explaining things to Julia. They seem in love and to only
have eyes for each other, while masses of people stream by
them, going from one class to the next.

INT. LIBRARY, EAST HAMPSHIRE COLLEGE - DAY

Nic sits at a computer. Typing. Focused.

EXT. EAST HAMPSHIRE COLLEGE GROUNDS - DAY

Julia runs her hands through Nic's hair. They kiss and
playfully roll on the lawn.

INT. LIBRARY, EAST HAMPSHIRE COLLEGE - DAY

Nic and Julia sit in the library. As they have to be silent,
they write little notes to each other. They giggle.

INT. LIVING ROOM, JULIA'S HOUSE - DUSK

They're sitting at the table, having dinner. JULIA'S MOTHER
and FATHER and 2 younger BROTHERS, an OLDER SISTER and
JULIA'S UNCLE.

They're all really nice and the atmosphere is pretty relaxed,
yet we get the sense Nic doesn't fit 100% in this average
middle class family, with his wild hair, torn jeans, worn
sneakers.

Julia's family is chit-chatting away, going back and forth,
LOUDER and LOUDER.

Nic is trying to follow the conversation and wants to make a
good impression, but it all makes him pretty nervous
actually.

NIC
(to Julia)
Can I use the bathroom?
(she didn't catch it)
Hey is there a bathroom I can use?

Julia's mother heard it.

JULIA'S MOTHER
Of course honey. Come, I'll show
you.

===

Nic gets up.

INT. BATHROOM, JULIA'S HOUSE - DUSK

Nic enters a bathroom. He takes a moment for himself, then
takes a piss.

While he is slowly washing his hands he sees a couple of
medication bottles in the bathroom cabinet. He goes through
them, sees a bottle of Percocet. He stares at it.

He dries his hands. He closes the cabinet.

INT. LIVING ROOM, JULIA'S HOUSE - LATER

Back at the table. It's after dinner, everybody still
chatting quite loud, Nic is more relaxed.

INT. NIC'S DORM ROOM, EAST HAMPSHIRE COLLEGE - DAY

Nic is on his bed on campus, a little passed out. His cell
phone rings, it says 'DAD'. Nic wakes up, and quickly gets
up.

He takes a moment to gather himself before answering the
phone.

NIC
Hey dad!

DAVID (O.S.)
Hey Nic. How you doing? What's
going on?

NIC
Everything is going great. Hey,
thanks for sending me that money. I
really appreciate that.

INT. LIBRARY, COLLEGE - DAY
Nic sits at a computer and is surfing the web. We see a
website that shows how to shoot yourself up.
He looks over his shoulder to make sure no one is watching.

INT. NIC'S DORM ROOM, EAST HAMPSHIRE COLLEGE - DAY

Nic is fighting with Julia.

===

INT. NIC'S DORM ROOM, EAST HAMPSHIRE COLLEGE - DAY

Nic is preparing the drugs, making it liquid, getting it in
the syringe, prepping his arm. It's all a bit clumsy as he's
never done this.

EXT. EAST HAMPSHIRE COLLEGE GROUNDS - NIGHT

It's cold outside, people are wearing warm winter jackets and
caps. We spot Nic, zoned out, only wearing a T-shirt. He's
really high. He stops, stands still.

Closes his eyes.

INT. LIVING ROOM, SHEFF HOUSE - DAY

Some time later. Nic is arriving back home for the holidays.
He is carrying a bag and enters the living room. David is
behind him and talking.

DAVID
And Patrick and Phil are going
hiking tomorrow. I told them we
might join. They definitely want to
see you.

They hear gentle shrieks of laughter. Nic looks around the
living room, nobody there. David and Nic pretend to keep on
talking while looking for the kids who've hidden themselves.

Nic discovers banners made by the kids to welcome him. One is
a hedgehog saying 'BOOHOO I MISS NIC'. Nic is moved by it and
expresses that to David inaudibly.

Nic then discovers where the kids are hiding but continues to
play it cool.

NIC
Are Jasper and Daisy here?

DAVID
They're not here.

NIC
No? Oh they didn't want to see me?

DAVID
Nope, they didn't want to see you.

===

NIC
Oh that's tough to hear. I'll just
have a seat on this couch and think
about that.

Nic sits down and then rips off the cover revealing the kids.

They now jump on Nic, he takes 'em both in his arms. They
kinda crawl all over him. He holds them tight.

Karen enters the living room too, and smiles.

NIC (CONT'D)
You've grown so big guys! This is
amazing!!! I can hardly hold you.

But he does hold them and then starts turning around his
axis, like a human merry-go-round. Nic starts going faster
and faster as the kids are cheering. David and Karen don't
know whether to laugh, because it's so funny, or to try and
stop them, because it does look a little dangerous. But
they're all laughing so loud. When Nic slows down he almost
starts losing balance, he's a little dizzy.

Nic smiles and hugs and kisses Karen.

EXT. BACK YARD - DUSK

The Sheffs are having a nice dinner outside. Enjoying great
food. So much to talk about.

After dinner they play a wordgame. When someone snaps the
other person has to tell the next line of the story.

Nic starts.

NIC
(storytelling voice)
Denmark, 1632.

Snap.

DAVID
We like to look back at the history
of hula hoops.

Snap. The little ones laughing uncontrollably.

NIC
So important to the culture of
peace and wisdom.

Snap. More laughter.

===

DAVID
A man named George--

A quick *snap.*

NIC
Hoop Hula was--

*Snap.*

DAVID
Thought I'm going to develop
something...

The family loses it. The kids barely containing their joy.

**INT. UPSTAIRS HALLWAY, SHEFF HOUSE - NIGHT**

Nic turns out the light in Jaspers bedroom. He closes the
door. Alone in the hallway, he scratches his skin.

DAVID (O.S.)
Hey.

NIC
Oh hey.

Suddenly David is there.

NIC (CONT'D)
Hey, um, I was wondering if I could
use the car? I still want to go to
a meeting tonight.

DAVID
You have a meeting tonight? Yeah,
sure.

David leans on the banister. He takes a long look at Nic.

DAVID (CONT'D)
You good?

Nic motions towards the kid's door and laughs to dodge the
question.

NIC
Yeah... They're crazy.

DAVID
They're really excited you are
home.

===

Nic puts his hands in his pockets.

NIC
I'll see you in the morning I
guess.

DAVID
OK.


INT. VOLVO/ROADS HOME TO INVERNESS - NIGHT

Nic is driving. He's shivering. Feels bad. He puffs a joint.

While he is driving, he dials a number. A car passes.

Muffled sounds. Image becomes blurry. Music blasts.

Headlights on the winding roads.

INT. NIC'S BEDROOM, SHEFF HOUSE - DAY
Nic wakes up with a huge hangover. It takes a while before he
realizes where he is, in his bed. He hears the kids fighting
in the room next door.

JASPER (O.S.)
Where is it? Where is it?

We hear Daisy crying.

INT. KID'S BEDROOM, SHEFF HOUSE - DAY

Big drama.

JASPER
Give it back!

DAISY
I don't have it!

They push each other around a little. More crying. David
enters the room.

DAVID
What is going on here?

JASPER
I had 8 dollars. Daisy took it.

Jasper holds his plastic mini-vault in his hands. It's empty.

===

DAISY
I didn't!!

DAVID
Calm down guys. Please calm down.
Daisy, can you go down to your mom
please?

DAISY
I didn't take it, daddy.

DAVID
OK, please go down.

Daisy goes down. David turns to Jasper.

DAVID (CONT'D)
Are you sure it was in there?

JASPER
Yes. I had it yesterday.

INT. KITCHEN, SHEFF HOUSE - DAY

Nic sits at the table and does not look great. David stares
hard at him, and sees his trembling hands, his gyrating jaw.

It looks like David hasn't slept a lot either.

DAVID
Jasper's savings disappeared.

NIC
Yeah? That's weird.

DAVID
Did you take his 8 dollars?

NIC
What?

DAVID
You heard me.

NIC
Why would I?

DAVID
Well, it disappeared, so someone
must have done it.

NIC
Right, so it's me?

===

Nic slams down his juice.

NIC (CONT'D)
This is fucking ridiculous!

He stands up.

DAVID
Nic, are you using again?

NIC
Am I using again?? No.

David examines him.

DAVID
Are you high right now?

NIC
What the fu... No... fuck you.

David is boiling.

DAVID
Fuck you? Don't talk to me that
way.

*(a beat)*

Are you high right now?

NIC
No.

DAVID
You're not using right now? Are you
using??

NIC
No Dad I'm not fucking high right
now!

DAVID
OK.

He looks down. This is hard.

DAVID (CONT'D)
Listen it was a gamble to send you
to college. Everybody supported it.
I'm glad that you went. Relapse is
a part of recov--

He can barely get the words out.

===

DAVID (CONT'D)
Relapse is a part of recovery. So--

NIC
I'd better leave.

Nic heads off to his room. David doesn't know what to do.

INT. NIC'S BEDROOM, SHEFF HOUSE - DAY

Nic sits on his bed motionless, thinking for a moment.

Suddenly he starts filling a suitcase and his duffel-bag with
clothes. Grabs some stuff that is lying on his desk. He takes
his guitar and walks out.

INT. HALLWAY, SHEFF HOUSE - DAY

Nic - with suitcase, duffel bag and guitar - sees David and
Karen standing in the doorway.

DAVID
Hey, just... where are you going to
go? You can't just leave. This is
ridiculous. Come on.

KAREN
Can you talk to us? We just want to
talk to you.

She takes a step towards him.

DAVID
Please, try to help us understand.

KAREN
Or just let us help you.

This makes Nic freak out.

NIC
*(screaming)*
I don't want your fucking help.
Don't you understand that? No you
don't? Jesus Christ, what the fuck
is wrong with you then, huh? What
the hell is wrong with you people?

Very aggressively he pushes David away.

===

NIC (CONT'D)
You people suffocate me!! You
fucking suffocate me!!

And now David loses it. He not only panics, but becomes
furious.

DAVID
Oh, it's us? We're the problem?
No!!

Nic runs out.

EXT. DRIVEWAY, SHEFF HOUSE - DAY

David chases out after him.

DAVID
You are the one who is doing it!!!
You're the one causing it and
you're the only one who can stop it
and FUCKING solve it!!!

David closes his eyes. Fuck, so stupid.

INT. NIC'S BEDROOM, SHEFF HOUSE - NIGHT

David enters Nic's room. Everything is still the way it was
when Nic left in a fury.

Some clothes scattered around. He sits on the bed, takes the
room in. He turns on a lamp on Nic's night-stand as we

CUT TO:

INT. NIC'S BEDROOM, SHEFF HOUSE - (FLASHBACK)

Just earlier.

Nic storms into his room right after the 8 dollar fight in
the kitchen. He wildly knocks books off of his desk, pounds
the wall and screams, before grabbing his bags to pack and
leave.

BACK TO:

===

INT. NIC'S BEDROOM, SHEFF HOUSE - NIGHT

David sees a notebook laying on the ground. He picks it up
and flips through it. We see it's a journal, with short, and
longer very personal writings.

Close on David as he starts to read. He flips another page.
Scribbles, hard to read what is there. Another page. We read
what he reads:

1 1/2 grams speed / Klonopin /
Codeine / Valium / Hard to find
meth here. Scored some heroin
instead.

He flips to the next page, which is filled with chaotic small
written text.

David looks closer at the nervous, crazy handwriting. This is
the Disease talking. As if he can experience his son being
changed by the drugs.

He reads a last sentence:

So all I can do is move forward...
and don't look back.

He closes the notebook. David looks terrified.

INT. VOLVO / GOLDEN GATE BRIDGE - DAY

David drives by himself back to Los Angeles.

INT. MEDICAL OFFICE AT UCLA - DAY

David is seated with DR. BROWN.

We have arrived back at the opening scene.

DR BROWN
So this is for the New York Times
Magazine?

DAVID
No. I'm sorry... I write, I
freelance for different magazines
but this is a personal matter.

DR BROWN (O.S.)
A personal matter?

===

DAVID
Yes. I'm sorry, is that okay?

DR BROWN (O.S.)
That's absolutely okay. May I ask
what this is regarding?

DAVID
It's about my son.

DR BROWN
Okay...

As David begins to talk we

INTERCUT WITH:

INT. HAIGHT STREET - DUSK

David on the famous Haight Street in San Francisco, looking
for Nic. We see the colorful shops. Kids with dreadlocks and
dogs. Tourists with dyed hair. Tattoos. Older hippies.

DAVID (O.S.)
He has been doing all sorts of
drugs but is addicted to crystal
meth, which seems to be the worst
of all of them. And I guess I am
here because I just want to know
all that I can about all of it.

Dr. Brown is now extremely precise in his use of language.

DR BROWN
So crystal meth gives the user a
feeling of instant euphoria, at
least when he takes it. But when it
wears off with a depletion of as
much as 60 percent of the dopamine
the user has to up the doses.

David walking on Haight Street. Still looking.

DR BROWN (O.S.) (CONT'D)
Double it, triple it. Just to feel
something.

Back at UCLA.

===

DR BROWN (CONT'D)
Causing even more nerve damage
which increases the compulsion to
use. Horrible cycle.

CUT TO:

INT. DAVID'S STUDY, SHEFF HOUSE - NIGHT
David sitting in the dark at the computer. Karen walks in.

KAREN
What's up?

She rests her hands on his shoulders. His eyes stay fixed on
the screen.

DAVID
Just doing some research.

BACK TO:

INT. HAIGHT STREET - DUSK

David hesitates then walks up to a girl DIANE (19), she
shields her eyes, takes him in. He looks closely at Diane,
she's still really young, but has clearly been damaged by the
drug abuse too.

DAVID
Hey, I... Are you hungry? You want
to get something?

DIANE
Most guys just ask me for a
blowjob.

DAVID
Yeah, well, I just want to offer
you something to eat. And talk a
little. If you're up for it.

INT. MEDICAL OFFICE AT UCLA - DAY

Dr. Brown and David are now watching a screen with brain
scans. We see a lateral cross-section of a brain, with blue
patches and yellow and red areas. The doctor points out the
red areas.

===

DR BROWN
The meth changes the brain
physically. Here we see the loss of
dopamine receptors in a meth user's
brain. Now I want to show you
something else here. Do you see
these two large red spots right
here? What that shows is
hyperactivity in the amygdala. The
amygdala is a region of the brain
that is linked with anxiety and
fear. Here, the amygdala is
screaming. What this shows us is
that there is a biological basis
that meth users may be unable, not
un-willing, but unable to
participate in normal treatment
plans.

INT. OLD DINER - DUSK
David and Diane are sitting in a booth. Diane slurps her
Sprite.

DIANE
I was in rehab too. 3 times. Ran
away every time.

A waiter brings two burgers. Diane starts eating.

DAVID
Why?

DIANE
It was hell, I wanted to die.

DAVID
Why was it hell?

DIANE
All that God shit. Also, you just
don't know how good it gets when it
gets good.

David is listening intently.

DIANE (CONT'D)
It's hard to explain. It feels like
cocaine but multiply it by 1000...
Or like a million.

===

INT. MEDICAL OFFICE AT UCLA

David and Dr Brown are still at the computer.

DAVID
What does this mean for Nic?

DR BROWN
Look Mr. Sheff, I don't know who
promised you what, but success
percentage is in the single digits.
David looks down.

DAVID
OK.

INT. OLD DINER

DAVID
What about your parents?

No reaction.

DIANE
What about 'em?

DAVID
Don't you think they're worried
about you? Shouldn't you let them
know...

DIANE
They don't care...

DAVID
I think they do.

DIANE
What the fuck do you know?

She stares at him. He stares back. It becomes uncomfortable.

David realizes that she's right, what does he know?

Diane stands up.

DIANE (CONT'D)
I gotta go.

DAVID
Oh. Ok. I'm...

And before he can say...

DAVID (CONT'D)
Thanks.

...she's off.

David looks at his untouched burger.

I/E. VOLVO / SAN FRANCISCO STREET/TENDERLOIN - NIGHT

It's dark now. David drives through the Tenderloin, an area
with strip clubs and cheap monthly hotel rooms, homeless
people, hustlers, dealers and junkies. He cruises the streets
and looks left and right. Heavy. He can't believe his son
might be here? Hard to grasp it.

David parks his car and exits. He approaches to some junkies
huddled on the sidewalk.

INT. DAVID'S STUDY, SHEFF HOUSE - NIGHT

David sits at his desk for a while.

He stares at his wallet. He opens it up and takes out:
crystalline powder. He watches it for a long time. His
adversary. What is it with that shit?

He takes a credit card out of his wallet. Clumsy he cuts the
drug a little. He takes a dollar bill and rolls it up.

He snorts the meth, stares in front of him.

We stay on his face. For a long time. He closes his eyes and
tries to feel and understand what this drugs is doing to him.

His HEART is BEATING like hell. He feels as if Roman candles
have been lit in his skull. We hear bits and pieces of MUSIC.
And SOUNDS everywhere in the house. He hears a CAR PASSING by
the house. He opens his eyes. He starts typing some
thoughts.

Another sound. A garden light equipped with a motion detector
flashes on. David gets up. Looks outside. Nothing.

David back at his desk. It's a mess. Papers and pictures and
books all over. The sun rises outside.

David is on his back on the floor in his study. He opens his
eyes, feels miserable, tries to get back to his senses,
crawls up.

===

INT. KITCHEN, SHEFF HOUSE - MORNING

Birds are chirping. David looks out the window. He was awake
the entire night.

INT. CAFFE TRIESTE - AFTERNOON

David alone at the window seat at Caffe Trieste in San
Francisco (landmark coffee shop in North Beach). The empty
coffee cup and glass of water suggest he's been there a
while. David looks outside.

CUT TO:

INT. CAFFE TRIESTE - AFTERNOON (FLASHBACK)

A younger David and Nic (6 years old) settle in at a table.
Nic is asking questions all the time. David lavishes his full
attention on Nic. He answers Nic with great dedication.

DAVID
I'm going to try some Klingon on
you.

He speaks in Klingon. Nic interprets.

NIC
Can I have a Coca-Cola?

DAVID
Exactly! That's exactly what I
asked.

NIC
Can I have a Coca-Cola?

DAVID
If you ask me in Klingon maybe I'll
get you a Coke.

Nic tries but it mostly sounds like gibberish. It's cute.

BACK TO:

INT. CAFFE TRIESTE - AFTERNOON

At length Nic appears, chalk-white, like a ghostly Egon
Schiele self-portrait, debauched, wasted. They hug. Nic sits.
His fingers tremble, his jaw gyrates, he grinds his teeth.

===

David looks at Nic. Nic can't look David in the eyes so he
looks anywhere else.

NIC
This place hasn't changed at all.
David gets right to it.

DAVID
So how ya doing?

NIC
I'm doing great. OK. I'm just doing
what needs to be done.

A pause. David doesn't believe it's true, it just can't be.

DAVID
What does that mean?

NIC
Being responsible for myself. I've
quit on my own. I've got five days
now.
(pause)
I feel like I'm doing well but I
just need a few hundred bucks
though.

It breaks David's heart. Ok, so that's why he called. But
David swallows his pride, needs to find a way to get through
to Nic. He stares at Nic, who can't seem to look in David's
eyes. Nic now stares outside. David fiddles with his cutlery.

DAVID
Nic, I can't give you any money.

NIC
It's just a few hundred bucks. I
just need to get some shit
together. I want to go to New York.

DAVID
New York?

NIC
I need to get out of San Francisco,
too many bad vibes here.
*(beat)*
I just need a few hundred bucks.

DAVID
Why don't we just have lunch. And
talk. We can do that, can't we?

===

This makes Nic a little mad and fidgety. He calms down. He
switches between being the old sweet Nic, and this
unreasonable junkie.

NIC
How are Karen... and the kids?

DAVID
OK. They ask about you.
(pause)
Next week is their step-up
ceremony. I'm sure they'd love you
to be there. I'd love you to be
there...

NIC
See, you're guilt-tripping me...
Look, dad, I already feel horrible
about myself.

DAVID
I know they wanted you to be there.
That's all.

NIC
I'm sorry, dad, I just need some
fucking money alright. So please...

DAVID
And then what? Where does this end?

NIC
I don't know. It's kinda working
out for me right now. You know, I
gotta see this through. I got five
days sober...

DAVID
It doesn't look like it's working.

NIC
Oh it doesn't look like it's
working out? So what then? Therapy?

DAVID
You can come home. We'll make it
work. Please Nic. Please.

NIC
That wouldn't... No.

DAVID
I've been doing some research.

===

NIC
Been doing fucking research?!
You've gotta be kidding me, dad!

DAVID
You think you have this under
control and I understand how scared
you are.

Nic gets mad.

NIC
I understand why I do things. It
doesn't make me any different. I'm
attracted to craziness and you're
just embarrassed because I was like
this amazing thing, like your
special creation or something, and
you don't like who I am now.

David looks at Nic... wondering where Nic is heading...

DAVID
Yeah? And who are you Nic?

NIC
(*defiant*)
This is me. Here. This is who I am.
You don't like what you see?
(*a long pause*)
You know, the more I think about
it, Mom should have gotten custody.
Because you always got to be
fucking controlling everything all
the time.

DAVID
Nic, you're allowed to be mad at
me. I made mistakes. I wish I
hadn't, but I did. But what you are
saying right now... it doesn't make
any sense.


NIC
You're doing it right now!!!
You are controlling me right now!!!

David stayed calm until now, but loses his cool here...

DAVID
This is not you. This is not you
Nic. This is the drugs talking.

===

NIC
What does that even fucking mean?

DAVID
Psychological terror! It's what
addicts do.

NIC
Yeah? And what the fuck are you
doing right now, huh? What is this?
What are you doing?

A pause. David looks at Nic, Nic doesn't dare to look back.

NIC (CONT'D)
I didn't want it to go like this.
(another beat)
Alright. I should go dad.

David puts his hands up. A peace offering, 'please wait'.

DAVID
Let me book you a room at a hotel
for a couple of nights?

NIC
No dad. No.

DAVID
Why don't we just go get some food?

Nic puts on his hat.

NIC
I gotta go.

He turns away from David...

DAVID
Will you say goodbye at least?

NIC
Bye, dad.

Nic rushes out of the cafe. David stays behind. Suddenly
aware that a lot of people are watching him.

INT. KID'S BEDROOM, SHEFF HOUSE - NIGHT

David and Jasper lay on the floor. Jasper's head resting on
David's chest.

===

JASPER
Where does he sleep?

DAVID
Don't worry about that sweetie.
He's fine.

JASPER
Maybe he has a friend and he sleeps
there?

DAVID
Maybe.

On the couch Karen stops reading to Daisy and looks over to
the boys.

JASPER
Can I call him?

DAVID
I tried. His phone is disconnected.

JASPER
Can I send him a message? Maybe
he'll get it when he turns his
phone back on.

DAVID
Yes. That's a great idea. Let's try
that.

David takes out his phone.

INT. DAVID'S STUDY, SHEFF HOUSE - NIGHT

David sits at the computer. Karen is there too, sipping tea.
She offers it to him. He declines. Starts reading.

CUT TO:

The next day.

David types into a word document, filling the page. He pauses
for a moment to take a sip of coffee and review his work.

INT. LIVING ROOM, SHEFF HOUSE - NIGHT

David stands by the fireplace. He hears the sound of a car
nearby. He looks out the window. The car passes by without
stopping.

===

**INT. LIVING ROOM, SHEFF HOUSE - DAY**

David sits on the couch, stares blankly in front of him.

KAREN (O.S.)
Dave, we're coming out. Close your
eyes!

DAVID
OK!

He closes his eyes. We hear some noises, Karen and the kids
are entering the living room.

KAREN
OK! You can open them!

He opens his eyes and sees his kids, all dressed up. Jasper
in white oxford, Daisy in a cute little dress.

DAVID
Oh wow... Amazing guys!

He smiles, while the kids make funny poses.

**INT. AUDITORIUM, ELEMENTARY SCHOOL - DAY**

We're mid-ceremony of the “step-up” ceremony, a long-standing
tradition at Jasper and Daisy's elementary school.
All the CHILDREN are dressed up and standing in front of
their chairs. The kids are singing and depicting the lyrics
to “Catch a Falling Star” with simple movements. It's
beautiful.

David stares straight ahead. He's emotional - struggling not
to break down.

**INT. DAVID AND KAREN'S BEDROOM - NIGHT**

The phone rings, louder and louder. It's deep in the night.
David slowly rolls over, awake, confused. He looks at the
phone on the bedside table - ringing, glowing - like it's the
most evil thing in the world. He knows what this call is, of
course. He answers.

DAVID
Hello.

===

VOICE ON PHONE (O.S.)
This is Julie Ford. I'm the
admissions nurse at Bellevue
Hospital, New York. Is Nic Sheff
your son?

**E/I. DRIVEWAY / LIVING ROOM, SHEFF HOUSE - DAY**

David drives off in a hurry. Karen - from the living room watches him drive away.

**INT. DEPARTURES, SF AIRPORT - NIGHT**

David sits at the gate with his arms crossed. Still staring
straight ahead. There's hardly anyone there at this time.

**INT. PLANE BEFORE TAKEOFF - SOON AFTER**

David is in his seat, the plane almost fully boarded. He is
on the phone.

BELLEVUE DOCTOR (O.S.)
Mr. Sheff, sorry we missed each
other earlier. So Nic is still
experiencing some respiratory
depression but his vital signs are
returning.

A flight attendant comes to reprimand David, as the doors are
closed.

FLIGHT ATTENDANT
Sir? Sir! We are ready for
departure.

DAVID
OK. Okay...
(to the Doctor)
May I talk to him?

BELLEVUE DOCTOR (O.S.)
No I'm sorry but that won't be
possible. He's sleeping right now
and we shouldn't wake him up. Try
again in a few hours.

FLIGHT ATTENDANT
Sir I need you to turn off your
phone.

David holds his hand up...

===


DAVID
Okay.

FLIGHT ATTENDANT
Sir!


DAVID
(to the Doctor)
Would you please let him know that
I'm on my way.

INT. NY ST. AUGUSTUS HOSPITAL, NEW YORK - HOURS LATER (DAY)

Nervous David walks to a NURSE at a busy nurses' station.

NURSE
I'm sorry sir. He checked out.
Against doctors orders.

DAVID
What? No. No! He OD'ed.

NURSE
I'm sorry sir. He pulled out the IV
and catheter and left.

DAVID
How long ago?

NURSE
Ten, fifteen minutes. I'm sorry
sir.

Damn. David sighs. What now?

INT. JFK - DUSK

David is waiting at a nearly empty gate. Again. His phone
rings. He answers.


DAVID
Yes...?

All we hear on the other end is a quivering voice.

**INT. DONUT SHOP - NIGHT**

David enters a rundown donut shop. He sees Nic sitting at a
table inside, almost falling asleep, unaware of David. He
looks the worst we've ever seen him. David watches him for a
moment, then takes a seat opposite Nic, who opens his eyes.

===

David doesn't know what to say. Tears come down on Nic's
cheek. David feels for him, he looks sad and vulnerable.

NIC
Look, I've thought about it and I'm
done with drugs. Finished. This is
it. I'm telling you dad, I'm done.
David thinks it's bullshit, but doesn't show it. He pauses.
Instead he tries to find a way to get through to Nic.

DAVID
And how would that work? I mean,
after what just happened.
Nic thinks about it, realizes his fantasy, starts crying.

INT. HOTEL ROOM - NIGHT

A bland hotel room. The TV on local news. David on the phone
with Vicki. Meanwhile Nic lays on the floor in his underwear.
The rest of his clothes scattered across the room.
On the desk we see remnants of a pizza ordered in the room.

DAVID
So at 3 there is a conference call
with the intake people of
Mississippi. And 3:30 one in New
Mexico. At 4 the one in Oregon.

VICKI (O.S.)
I did some research on the New
Mexico one.

DAVID
Yeah?

VICKI (O.S.)
They charge $40,000 a month.

DAVID
You know, it's not even that well
rated. We'll just skip that one.

VICKI (O.S.)
Listen, if a spot opens up here in
Los Angeles maybe that's the best
solution for now. I'll hear back
from them in an hour.

David looks over at Nic on the floor.

===

VICKI (O.S.) (CONT'D)
Give it a rest David. Why don't you
let me take over for now.

The phone call now over, David covers Nic with a blanket.
He looks at him on the floor. His thin and frail body. The
marks on his arms. He rubs his hair, 'good night'.

MATCH CUT TO:

INT. NIC'S OLD BEDROOM - NIGHT (FLASHBACK)

A younger David rubbing 4-year-old Nic's hair as he lies in
his bed and is almost sleeping. David closes a book, just
finished telling a story. Nic's eyelids are dropping.

NIC
Daddy?

DAVID
Yes?

NIC
Will you check on me every 15
minutes?

David smiles, tucks Nic in.

DAVID
Yes.

Nic - perfectly safe - closes his eyes, drifts away in his
sleep.

Then, in his beautiful, slightly off-key, imperfect singing
voice, David sings the John Lennon song “Beautiful Boy”

DAVID (CONT'D)
*Close your eyes,
Have no fear,
The monster's gone,
He's on the run
And your daddy's here.
Beautiful, beautiful, beautiful Beautiful Boy
Before you cross the street,
Take my hand,
Life is just what happens to you
While you're busy making other
plans.
Beautiful, beautiful, beautiful Beautiful Boy. [etc.]*

===

David's singing continues as we

CUT TO:

**INT. NIC'S OLD BEDROOM - DAY (FLASHBACK, CONT.)**

Where he and Nic are now packing a Hello Kitty suitcase.
Clothes and toys. Now Nic is silent, and David is talking all
the time.

DAVID
Didn't you want to take your
trolls?

Nic shakes his head.

(in the background, David's singing is now backed by the
original John Lennon track)

David walks to Nic's bookcase.

DAVID (CONT'D)
How about a book?

Nic is pretty quiet. He shakes his head no.

INT. DEPARTURES, SF AIRPORT - DAY (FLASHBACK CONT'D)

David and Nic are at the gate. Nic is wearing a pink paper
badge with his name written in Magic Marker.

A Delta flight attendant is waiting while David is saying
goodbye to Nic. Other UNACCOMPANIED MINORS start to board.

David kneels to say goodbye to Nic. Nic is sulking.

The song softens in the background.

DAVID
Can I get a hug?

Nic shakes his head.

DAVID (CONT'D)
What, no? No hug? Why not?

Indeed, no hug.

DAVID (CONT'D)
Are you mad at me? Cos you have to
go?

===

An angry yes. The music fades.

DAVID (CONT'D)
OK. But you'll be happy to see your
mommy, right?

Also a yes. But also close to tears.

DAVID (CONT'D)
I want you to know something, when
you come back I'm going to be here.
I'm going to be right here for you.
OK? And call me when you miss me
and I'll call you.

Nic nods.

DAVID (CONT'D)
Do you know how much I love you?

Nic shakes his head hesitantly.

The airline attendant is watching, a little nervous, they
need to go, but she doesn't want to come in between.

DAVID (CONT'D)
If you could take all the words in
the language, it still wouldn't
describe how much I love you. And
even if I could gather all those
words together, that still wouldn't
describe what I feel for you. What
I feel for you means everything. I
love you more than everything.

NIC
Everything?

DAVID
Everything.

Nic hugs David now. Then gets up. The airline attendant takes
Nic's hand.

David nods. Nic walks away with the airline attendant.

INT. REHAB 3 - DAY

Vicki walks into a new rehab. Less fancy this time. She finds
Nic - looking just a little better - having breakfast with a
couple of timid YOUNGER GUYS. Nic is a rehab sophomore now.

===

He looks up, sees Vicki standing there. She smiles when he
sees her.

NIC
Hey! That's my mom.

INT. LIVING ROOM, REHAB 3 - DAY

Nic and Vicki sit in sofas and are drinking tea. They're both
pretty relaxed actually, considering the circumstances.

VICKI
I'm really glad you came to LA. You
know that right?

She looks Nic straight in the eyes before speaking through
sobs.

VICKI (CONT'D)
You just don't know what it is to
be a parent.

Nic stares straight ahead.

NIC
Please don't do this mom.

She fights to hold back her tears and pull it together.

VICKI
All I could think about was you.

NIC
I know this must sound meaningless,
but I'm sorry. I really am.

VICKI
Oh Nicky...

She puts her arm around him and pulls him in closer.

VICKI (CONT'D)
You're such a darling. You know
that, right?

Nic shakes his head. He doesn't believe it.

She kisses his forehead 3 times, short, longer, longest.

MUSIC RISES.

===

EXT. ROADS, TOPANGA CANYON - DAY

Nic appears in the distance, riding his 10-speed through
Topanga Canyon. Although he is drenched in sweat and grunting
he looks pretty great actually.

MUSIC is BIG now.

Changing gears, up a hill, down a hill.

We now see he is chasing SPENCER (40's), his sponsor. He's
pushing it 200%.

As they arrive at a steep hill, Nic, younger and lighter,
overtakes Spencer.

NIC
Come on old man!

SPENCER
(playful)
You are being so disrespectful!

Spencer catches up to him.

SPENCER (CONT'D)
I'm coming for ya! You about to
look at my ass!

NIC
Motherfucker!

CLOSE on Nic who's in pain but does not give up. PRIMAL
AGONY, pedalling HARD:

NIC (CONT'D)
Aaaaaarrrrgggghhhhhhhhh!!

Nic reaches the top. In the background Spencer falls over in
defeat. Nic wins. They stop, laugh at each other.

Nic rides back to Spencer and helps him up.

SPENCER
So that's what I get for helping
you out? Thanks man.

NIC
Sorry old man. I'm ruthless!

Puffing. They enjoy the view.

===

EXT. GARDEN NIC'S STUDIO - DAY

Vicki and Nic are carrying Nic's stuff towards his studio,
which is located above a garage in the back of a garden of a
large house.

INT. STUDIO NIC - DAY

They enter the studio. Drop the stuff. Nic looks at his new
place. It's not huge, but his own. Nic opens a window and
looks outside.

When done, Nic sits down and watches his shelf with all his
stuff. Vicki watches him.

VICKI
How does this feel?

He smiles.

NIC
Like I'm a real human being.

INT. CHURCH - DAY

A 12-step meeting. Quite a lot of people. Lots of young and
hip people in LA.

Nic looks good. He takes in the space and speaks to the
group.

NIC
One day I tried methamphetamine and
I thought, this is what's been
missing. I felt complete. And I've
been chasing that high ever since.
No matter how much meth or whatever
else I can find to shoot up into my
body, I knew it's never enough. I
went to a couple of rehabs, a
detox, we would talk about disease.
Sure. But it never clicked. Until
one day I woke up in a hospital and
someone asked me, what's your
problem? I said I'm an alcoholic
and an addict and he said no that's
how you've been treating your
problem.

People nod 'that's right'. We see Vicki and Spencer seated
together in the back. Vicki watching. Spencer nodding.

===

NIC (CONT'D)
I know now I need to find a way to
fill this big black hole in me.
Anyway. I'm 14 months clean. I have
a job at a rehab, and it's
fulfilling to help other people get
sober. I have a sponsor, Spencer,
he shows me how great my life can
be sober. I still have a family. My
mom has been amazing. My dad has
been amazing too... I want them to
be proud of me.

I/E. MAZDA / VARIOUS LOCATIONS - DAY

Nic is driving a $500 Mazda on Inverness roads. “Heart of
Gold” by Neil Young plays. He opens the window and hangs his
arm outside. Enjoys this so so much.

INT. ROOM, HOUSE KAREN'S PARENTS - DAY (FLASHBACK)

A younger David is getting dressed, suit and bowtie. Nic, 8
years old here, sits on the bed, he is wearing a shirt that
is slightly too big, blue trousers and All Stars.

Nic is dangling his legs up and down.

DAVID
You alright? What's wrong? Are you
nervous.

NIC
Yeah.


EXT. TERRACE, HOUSE KAREN'S PARENTS - DUSK (FLASHBACK CONT'D)

David, Karen and Nic stand on a terrace, where they have
gathered with some friends and family for a cosy wedding. The
terrace has a great view of hills and trees. It's a beautiful
day.

Karen wears a simple white dress.

KAREN
(to David)
Thank you for marrying me. Thank
you for being a perfect partner in
an imperfect world. Thank you for
introducing me to your amazing son.
I'm here for you and I'm here to
stay.

===

People cheer.

DAVID
(to Karen)
Karen, thank you for loving me.

David looks at Nic.

DAVID (CONT'D)
And thank you for loving him.

They kiss. Karen gestures Nic to come in between them. Nic
holds hands with both of them. He smiles, although still
nervous. They kiss again.

Cheering!

CUT TO:

Drinks afterwards. It's joyful and informal. A couple of
musicians are playing music on their acoustic instruments.

Talking, laughing.

David is talking to a friend about Nic who stands a few feet
away dancing to the music.

The friend laughs. David and Karen look over at Nic. Still
dancing.

EXT. DRIVEWAY, SHEFF HOUSE - DAY

Back to the present.

Nic arrives home. He parks on the driveway. Steps out of the
car.

David appears. Then Jasper, Daisy, Karen. Everybody is
excited but also nervous. The dogs are BARKING LOUD, a little
aggressive.

Nic hugs everybody separately.

NIC
Dad. Good to see you.

CUT TO:

NIC (CONT'D)
Dayze.

CUT TO:

===

NIC (CONT'D)
Jazzy Jeff. I missed you more than
the sun misses the moon at night.

Jasper hugs him back, but is a little silent. They haven't
seen each other for such a long time.

NIC (CONT'D)
Hi Karen.

KAREN
Hey.

Somehow it's really tense when Nic and Karen hug. They both
have tiny tears.

NIC
Thank you for inviting me.
Seriously.

INT. NIC'S OLD BEDROOM, SHEFF HOUSE - DUSK

Nic enters his bedroom, which has been transformed into an
adjunct playroom with lots of LEGO-creations, easels, and art
projects.

He puts his bag on the floor, sits on his bed, looks at all
the toys.

Nic takes his laptop out of his backpack, and opens it. He
starts typing hesitantly, sometimes going back, correcting,
then continuing.

EXT. BACK YARD, SHEFF HOUSE - DAY

A glorious, sunny day. A lush green garden.

A garden sprinkler starts spraying water up in the air. It
moves from left to right. Nic, Jasper, and Daisy run and play
around it. They come close to it, yet try to avoid to get
wet. Laughter. Shrieks. Of course they get wet. Bright
colors, sunlight piercing the ropes of water splashing
through the air, the children's skin glistening.

David sits in a deck chair. He is trying to read the New
Yorker, but keeps looking up at his kids with a big smile.

Nic picks up Jasper in one arm and then Daisy in the other.
He spins them both through the sprinkler, the kids laugh as
hard as they can. David calls out.

===

DAVID
Hey! Easy.

But he can't help but laugh too.

INT. DAVID'S STUDY, SHEFF HOUSE - DAY

David is reading an e-mail to Karen.

DAVID
'... If the marker is depleted in
meth addicts' brains, it's likely
that there is a loss of nerve
terminals, and the brain damage is
irreversible. However, when I
tested for V-MAT2, I found normal
levels.'

KAREN
So there is cause for optimism?

DAVID
Normal levels is optimistic. Yes.

Karen looks at him.

KAREN
I was just checking!

He continues.

DAVID
Basically Nic's 'fried' nerve
endings can grow back. They say it
can take two years.

KAREN
Two years. Well, that's great
David.

Tiny smile from David.

INT. LIVING ROOM, SHEFF HOUSE - NIGHT

David sits at the fire place. He has a book in his hands but
isn't really reading. He hears a car stopping in front of the
house. He looks up.

CUT TO:

Nic walks in. Takes a seat. Watches David.

===

DAVID
You're pretty late.

NIC
Yeah. It was a great meeting. After
we went to this speaker's house and
watched a video. Some of my sober
sponsoring bro's were there.
David puts his book down.

DAVID
No phone?

NIC
My cell was dead.

DAVID
(hates to ask)
Would you be OK to do a drug test?

Nic becomes silent and angry too, but swallows his pride.

NIC
Yeah. Sure dad.

David stands up, goes to the kitchen, takes a plastic cup,
gives it to Nic.

DAVID
You understand why, right?

NIC
I should've called to let you know.

DAVID
So...
I trust you, but we just need to
have some kind of proof, ok?

Nic is a little down.

NIC
That's about as contradictory as it
gets. But I know. I'll do it, no
worries, nothing to hide.

A beat.

DAVID
Hey. You're doing great.

NIC
Yeah...

===

DAVID
You really are. By my count you're
at 485 days clean.

Nic nods.

NIC
I'll just leave it in the bathroom.

Nic walks away waving his plastic cup in his hands. He stops
and hugs David.

NIC (CONT'D)
Goodnight dad. I love you.

DAVID
I love you too.

Nic disappears in the dark.

INT. BATHROOM, SHEFF HOUSE - NIGHT

David checks the drug test. He turns off the light.

EXT. REMOTE BEACH - DAY

The family is walking on a path that leads to a beautiful
remote beach. Everybody is carrying something, stuff they
brought to spend a couple of hours there. Jasper and Nic are
carrying a surfboard. They're both really excited and teasing
each other as they walk.

They arrive at the beautiful beach, look at the pretty big
waves out there. Jasper and Nic run towards the water and
play a little in the water in the incoming waves.

Meanwhile, David and Karen install themselves on the beach.
Karen looks a little worried.

Nic and Jasper are strapping the leg ropes of their
surfboards on and making their way to go in the water and
surf.

NIC
Alright Jasper, you ready?

JASPER
Yep.

NIC
Let's go, let's go, let's go!

===

They run towards the water. Karen chases after them.

KAREN
Hey no, no, wait! Jasper I don't
want you to go out there.

JASPER
Mom, we won't go far. I swear!

KAREN
The waves are too big. It's too
dangerous.

JASPER
But I'm a great swimmer. I've been
in waves that were way bigger than
this.

KAREN
Yes I know that but-Nic joins the conversation, he is sweet.

NIC
I'll stay close...

JASPER
Nic will stay close, you see?

Karen is emotional about it, primal fear kicks in. David is
watching and senses it. He gets up from his seat.

NIC
Karen, I'm going to stay close.

KAREN
Nic can go in. That's fine, but
you, no. And that is final.

JASPER
(jokingly)
We'll see about that!

KAREN
Hey!

David takes a few step closer towards the boys. Nic tries to
stay positive.

NIC
Ok, it's fine. It's fine.

They all just stand there and look at the waves. They are
indeed quite big.

===

NIC (CONT'D)
(to Jasper)
Shall we play a game instead? Yeah?
Jasper is taken aback a little. He nods.

JASPER
Yeah.

Nic playfully bumps his head into Jasper's chest to cheer him
up. They head back up the beach.

CUT TO:

A little later. Karen, Daisy and David are building a castle.
Jasper and Nic are laying on the beach, face to face, playing
a wordgame.

NIC
Are you a hurfboard? No? Are you a
hicycle?

It makes Jasper laugh. He shakes his head.

NIC (CONT'D)
OK, uhm, are you edible?

JASPER
Not really.

NIC
Not really?

JASPER
Not really.

NIC
So sort of... Are you a house?

JASPER
Yes. How did you know?

NIC
Just, you know, I can read your
mind.

Jasper laughs. Nic sees David is following their
conversation.

NIC (CONT'D)
Hey... I know you're a great
swimmer. I'm going to be there to
cheer for you at your next swim
meet. How does that sound?

===

Jasper smiles. A silence. Nic looks at Jasper.

NIC (CONT'D)
Hey is it weird to see me after
such a long time or no?

JASPER
I guess it was at first. I thought
maybe you might be different. But
you're the same old Nic.

Now Nic smiles.

MUSIC RISES.

INT. KITCHEN, SHEFF HOUSE - DAY

Next morning. Bright sun through the windows. Nic walks in
and hugs David.

NIC
Thanks. It was a great weekend.

DAVID
Take care.

Nic nods.

EXT. DRIVEWAY, SHEFF HOUSE - DAY

Nic steps into his Mazda. The family gathers at the door.
While Nic drives off, they wave.

David is watching Nic drive off. And, isn't there a sad look
on Nic's face?

I/E. MAZDA / INVERNESS ROADS - DAY

Nic is driving on the Inverness roads.

EXT. MARIN VALLEY SCHOOL, SAN RAFAEL - DAY (FLASHBACK)

It's Nic's graduating class on the lovely grounds of Marin
Valley School. A BRASS BAND starts playing. YOUNG STUDENTS
start to walk up the grounds in a row. PARENTS, FRIENDS,
LOVED ONES are taking seats on the bleachers.

Amongst them the whole Sheff-family. David, Karen, Jasper,
Daisy.

===

David is talking to the FATHER of one of Nic's fellow
students. Karen, Daisy and Jasper are trying to spot Nic
among the students.

David and the whole family cheer now as Nic goes towards the
stage. Even other people are cheering for Nic. Little Daisy
is enraptured. David is really really proud.

DAVID
Go get'em!

Nic steps up - kisses the Principal - looks out and grins
wickedly to his family. David laughs.

While making his way down the stage, Nic shakes hands with
teachers standing in line with a big smile, he even hugs one
of them, the teacher is surprised.

As other student's names are called, OTHER FAMILIES are
cheering too. For David it feels like everybody is cheering
for Nic.

Before he steps off the stage, Nic waves to his family one
more time.

EXT. DRIVEWAY, SHEFF HOUSE - DAY

And we cut back to the moment when Nic gets in his Mazda and
drives off from the Sheff house.

Nic does look a little sad. He watches the family wave in his
rearview mirror.

I/E. MAZDA / FREEWAY - DAY

Nic is driving on the freeway. He's nervous. He takes an
exit.

I/E. MAZDA / PARKING - DAY

Nic sits in his car, close to the freeway, cars passing by in
the background.

He's out of sorts. He takes his phone and dials a number.

SPENCER (O.S.)
One day at a time, man.
Congratulations. Welcome to the
real world, I'm glad you made it.

===

NIC
I don't want to live in the real
world. I'm so sick of living in the
real world.

SPENCER (O.S.)
Bullshit. That's your disease
talking, man. Wanting to isolate
you, so it can kill you.

NIC
I don't feel like I have a disease,
Spencer. This is not like fucking
cancer. This is my fucking choice.
I put myself here.

SPENCER (O.S.)
Yeah you did. You did put yourself
here. Now are you going to let me
talk? Or what?

A beat.

SPENCER (O.S.) (CONT'D)
OK. You're a writer, right? So
write. You're good at it. This is
your day--

Nic puts down the phone. He is struggling. He picks it back
up.

SPENCER (O.S.) (CONT'D)
Once you get high though, you lose
everything. So you've gotta keep
choosing the right way.

Nic exits the car. He stands hunched over the open door.

NIC
Right.

He clenches his teeth.

SPENCER (O.S.)
That's right. Choose the right way.

Nic seems relieved.

NIC
Hey listen, I'm going to give you a
call a little later, alright? I
feel like I'm going to do alright.

===

SPENCER (O.S.)
You blowing me off now? Don't waste
my time. I'm here for you man. You
know what, I'm having some steaks
tonight. Why don't you come over
for dinner?

NIC
That sounds great. I'll see you
then. Yessir. I'll see you then.

Nic's lips start quivering, as if he's about to cry. Spencer
can feel him teetering in the silence on the phone.

SPENCER (O.S.)
Nic. Nic! Nic--

NIC
Alright, bye-bye.

Nic hangs up, but starts crying again. He closes the car door
and paces back and forth, swaying in every direction.

We now see where he is, he's at a parking lot overlooking the
Golden Gate Bridge and San Francisco.

EXT. MAZDA / HAIGHT STREET - NIGHT

Nic sits on the hood of his Mazda, parked in the colorful
Haight Street. A sixpack on the passenger seat, Nic takes a
can of beer and opens it. His eyes are on fire. He drinks.
He's smoking a cigarette. This is obviously just the
beginning, the beast is loose.

He downs the can of beer. Opens the next. He is looking at
his arms, making a fist, making his veins stand out.

He notices LAUREN walking by on the sidewalk (19, thin,
fragile girl). He knows her, but where from? She notices him,
and recognizes him too. She comes towards him.

LAUREN
Nic Sheff!
Hi...

NIC
Lauren...!


There's something strange about her, but she's also really
cute.

===

LAUREN
God it's been a long time. What are
you doing here?

NIC
Well...

Nic is thinking. Should he tell the truth?

LAUREN
What?

NIC
I've been sober for a while, but
I'm seriously looking to party
right now.

I/E. MAZDA / SAN FRANCISCO STREETS - MONTAGE

Nic drives while Lauren drinks a beer in the passenger.

They cruise through the shady Tenderloin. Nic parks. He takes
out another cigarette as two DEALERS walk over to the car.

He rolls down the window.

DEALER
I got what you need!

The dealer shakes two baggies. Nic reaches for both.

**INT. LIVING ROOM, LAUREN'S PARENTS HOUSE - NIGHT**

Nic and Lauren enter Lauren's house. A fancy place
overlooking Baker Beach. Nic sits on the couch and
immediately throws two syringes onto a glass coffee table.

NIC
Can you get me a cup of water and a
spoon?

LAUREN
Mmmhmm.

She exits. Nic sits and looks around the room, fiddling with
a baggie in his hand. She returns. He smiles.

LAUREN (CONT'D)
Here you go.

She hands him the water and puts the spoon on the table.

===

Nic prepares the drugs like a pro. Crushing the meth, heating
it up. Pulling it up a syringe. And another one, with a
little less. Lauren is watching, a little nervous.

Nic finds a vein and shoots up. He coughs, almost choking.
(happens when the chemicals reach the brain). His eyes water
up. His breathing intensifies.

NIC
Goddamn.... Godddamn.

CUT TO:

Now Nic shoots up Lauren.

NIC (CONT'D)
There it is. That's it.

She coughs too. A lot. Hard breathing.

LAUREN
Wow.

Nic smiles at her.

NIC
You see? I told ya.

They sit there staring at each other. Not saying a word. He
starts kissing her. She kisses him back. He kisses her
harder.

INT. BATHROOM, LAUREN'S PARENTS HOUSE - NIGHT

They have sex in the shower. It's wild and sexy. Nic looks
cool. They go on for a long time. Kissing, moaning, fucking.

Lauren comes. Nic keeps on going.

CUT TO:

INT. LIVING ROOM, LAUREN'S PARENTS HOUSE - DAY

Nic is sitting on the couch in his underwear next to his belt
still tied in a loop for his arm. He looks bad. He's been
throwing up.

He looks out at the coffee table. It's a huge mess. Bottles
of wine. Drug paraphernalia layed out. Crystal meth. Heroin.
Not much left.

===

He starts to cry. He curls into the fetal position and grabs
hold of the nearest pillow.

While he cries we hear David leaving him a voice-mail.

DAVID (O.S.)
It's dad again. I feel like you
might have been a little down when
you left, Nic. So I'm here to talk
if you need to.

CUT TO:

INT. DAVID'S STUDY, SHEFF HOUSE - DAY

David hangs up the phone. He sits in his study. Thinking.

EXT. BACK YARD, SHEFF HOUSE - DAY

David is on the phone. Making another call.

DAVID
So you have no idea where he is?

VICKI (O.S.)
Spencer told me he heard from him.
He was having a difficult time but
was pulling through. But, yeah,
he's not at work. Not at home.
Unreachable on his cell.

DAVID
Damn, Vicki. He left here two days
ago... Why haven't you checked on
him since? You're supposed to be
taking care of him, right?

[INTERCUT WITH VICKI IN HER OFFICE IN LA]

Vicki looks out of sorts.

VICKI
What the fuck, David. Who's been
taking care of him the last year?

DAVID
You could've checked on him! What
the fuck is your problem?

===

VICKI
What do you think I do all day? And
besides that, we can't run
surveillance on him 24/7.

DAVID
(not listening to Vicki)
I think you need to go to the
police right now and file a missing
persons report. OK?!

VICKI (O.S.)
Stop YELLING at me!!

DAVID
No I'm not going to stop yelling at
you! Because you are just... what
are you even doing there!

VICKI (O.S.)
You're being unfair David.

DAVID
Listen to me!

Vicki is grasping for air, it's too much for her. She starts
crying. She hangs up.

ON DAVID: his eyes like black saucers of rage.

All of a sudden he flings his phone across the lawn, into the
trees beyond the yard.

DAVID (CONT'D)
FUCK.

CUT TO:

David angrily rummages around in the foliage, looking for his
phone. Karen finds him.

KAREN
Dave?

David turns and sees her.

DAVID
(anguished)
Can you call my phone, please?

KAREN
What's going on?

===


DAVID
He's gone.

David is shaking his head. Karen too. What now? David starts
looking for his phone again. Karen too.

INT. BEDROOM DAVID & KAREN, SHEFF HOUSE - NIGHT

David is throwing UNDERWEAR, SHIRTS, a TOILETRIES POUCH and
other items into a TRAVEL BAG. Karen enters, giving David the
a 'what's-going-on'-look.

KAREN
How do we even know he's in LA? I
mean he could be in San Francisco.
He could be in fucking Mexico for
all we know.

DAVID
I need to go.

KAREN
And I need you to stay.

DAVID
I told you, Vicki can't handle it.

KAREN
I don't care about Vicki. This
isn't about Vicki!!

DAVID
Why don't you just relax and try to
be reasonable.

KAREN
What? You be reasonable!

DAVID
I am being reasonable.

KAREN
IS THIS REASONABLE?

DAVID
NO IT'S NOT! How can I be? My son
is out there somewhere and I don't
know what he's doing. I don't know
how to help him!

KAREN
YOU CAN'T!

===

David lets that sink in. It hurts but it might be true.

Karen is silent for a moment. Then sits on the bed.

Jasper enters their room in his PJ's, still sleepy.

KAREN (CONT'D)
Hey big man. What's up?

JASPER
I can't sleep.

She picks him up and carries him out of the room.

JASPER (O.S.) (CONT'D)
Good night daddy.

DAVID
Good night.

**EXT. ROAD LEADING TO POINT REYES LIGHTHOUSE - DAY - MONTAGE**

David is walking his dogs at the beautiful vista where he
once shared a joint with Nic.

**EXT. BACK YARD, SHEFF HOUSE - DAY**

Daisy and Jasper play on the swings. Carefree.

**INT. KAREN'S STUDIO - NIGHT**

Karen focuses on her work. Looking for the next brush stroke.

**INT. DAVID'S STUDY, SHEFF HOUSE - NIGHT**

David types and edits his work. Focused.

**INT. LIVING ROOM, SHEFF HOUSE - NIGHT**

David can't sleep. He picks LEGO's up off of the floor.

**INT. KID'S BEDROOM, SHEFF HOUSE - DAY**

Karen gets the kid's dressed, ready to go out.

===

**INT. ROLLING STONE MAGAZINE - MEETING ROOM - DAY**

David in a meeting room with a couple of editors. David is
trying his best to not constantly check his phone.

**EXT. PATHWAY LEADING TO INVERNESS AQUATICS CENTER - DAY**

David, Karen, Daisy and Jasper just parked the car and walk
to the entrance of the swimming pool. A lot of kids and
parents are arriving and entering.

Both Daisy and Jasper have a bag with their bathing suits.

JASPER
I thought Nic was gonna be here
today.

DAVID
Something came up.

JASPER
Can I call him?

DAVID
That's not going to be possible.

JASPER
Why not?

DAVID
Because it's not.

Silence. Jasper hesitates.

JASPER
Is Nic back on drugs again?

Wow. Karen looks at David. They both don't know what to say.
A long silence. Karen is honest.

KAREN
We don't know, honey.

Jasper nods. He walks off, takes Daisy along.

**INT. KITCHEN, SHEFF HOUSE - DAY**

The phone rings throughout the house. No answer. It clicks
through to an answer machine.

===

**EXT. DRIVEWAY, SHEFF HOUSE - DAY**

Nic and Lauren arrive at the front door, Nic lifts a pot
plant, nothing there. He tries another pot, again nothing.
It makes him angry. He throws the pot to the floor. He kicks
the solid door, nothing happens.

**EXT. BACK YARD - DAY**

Nic goes around the back. He creeps along different doors and
windows, and checks if one of them is open.

He starts banging and pounding on a back door, until it
breaks open and he slams to the ground. He bounces right back
up. If he weren't high, his limbs would hurt after this.

**INT. SHEFF HOUSE - DAY**

We follow Nic who walks through the house and gathers stuff
he can take along.

In a storage he takes a jacket, a Nintendo console, some
bottles of wine. An old laptop. From the kitchen a bottle of
Vodka. He dumps some stuff into a woven laundry basket.
Meanwhile Lauren is looking at art books, etc.

**INT. DAVID'S STUDY, SHEFF HOUSE - DAY**

Nic enters David's study. He opens drawers of his desk,
looking for stuff he can take. He's progressively angrier and
angrier.

On David's desk Nic sees print-outs of stuff David is
writing. He looks at it, his own name appears quite a few
times.

He reads the top line: Nic didn't come home last night.
Then the last: Have you seen my son? Have you seen my
beautiful boy? Tell him I miss him.

**INT. INVERNESS AQUATICS CENTER - DAY**

The competition is on. BOYS and GIRLS of all ages in their
bathing suits. Different TEAMS, amongst them Jasper's team
'Angry Tuna'. Jasper is just about to get on a starting
block, while David and Karen stand to the side of the pool.
Karen waves, but Jasper doesn't see her.

===

Behind Jasper we notice a large banner from the local swim
team that says: 'Nothing in life is so complicated that it
cannot be achieved by discipline and hard work'.

And GOOOOOOOO! Jasper dives into the water, and swims as fast
as he can. Karen is watching and cheering. David looks pretty
stressed out.

A little later, David walks out checking his phone. Karen
sees him walking out. She's angry. She focuses on Jasper
again.

**INT. LIVING ROOM, SHEFF HOUSE - DAY**

Nic is watching the basket and the stuff he wanted to take
with him . . . What a stupid idea.

At that moment we hear a car pull up in the driveway.
He rushes to a window. It's the family arriving. Nic, instant
panic mode.

NIC
Oh fuck.
(loud whisper)
Hey Lauren.

LAUREN
What's going on?

NIC
Let's go. We gotta go.

They rush out of the back.

**EXT. DRIVEWAY, SHEFF HOUSE - DAY**

In the driveway David, Karen, and the kids all get out of the
car. Jasper is wearing a medal around his neck. The back of
the car is filled with bags of groceries. David and Karen
pick them up and carry them.


KAREN
Honeys, can you help us out here?

They all take something - David the bulk. They walk to the
front door, Karen opens it. They enter.

**INT. LIVING ROOM AND KITCHEN, SHEFF HOUSE - DAY**

They pass the living room.

===

Dump the groceries in the kitchen.

Karen starts unpacking. Jasper takes a banana and starts
eating it, just hanging a little in the kitchen.

Daisy goes up the stairs to her room.

David heads back outside.

**EXT. DRIVEWAY, SHEFF HOUSE - DAY**

As David enters the house again with the last groceries, he
notices the broken plant pot at the entrance.

**INT. LIVING ROOM AND KITCHEN, SHEFF HOUSE - DAY**

David enters again with the last groceries.

JASPER
I think I just saw Nic...

KAREN
What hon?

JASPER
I think I just saw Nic and a girl.
Running away.

Dumbstruck for a moment... David rushes outside.

**EXT. DRIVEWAY, SHEFF HOUSE / AND STREETS SURROUNDING- DAY**

David runs onto the street, sees Nic and Lauren, but they're
pretty far away. They're running.


DAVID
Nic, Nic!

CUT TO:

Nic, white as a sheet, sprinting. Lauren beside him. They go
around a corner into a bush.

NIC
Fuck! Fuck!

CUT TO:

David runs on the street now, but doesn't see Nic anymore.

===

Karen, Daisy and Jasper run to the front door. Daisy calls
out.


DAISY
Nic!

Karen spins around.

KAREN
No! Stay inside. I am not kidding.

She shuts the door.

CUT TO:

Nic and Lauren clamber into the Mazda, try to be as quiet as
possible, though they're gasping for breath.

LAUREN
What do we do?

He kisses her and tries to calm her down.

NIC
It's alright. It's alright.

Through the bush they see David running past them.

NIC (CONT'D)
Oh fuck.

They wait just a little more until David is further along.

Nic starts the engine, hits the gas and rushes into the other
direction.

CUT TO:

David turns around as he sees and hears the Mazda drive off
in the other direction.

DAVID
Oh no...

Nic has to drive past the house. Nic sees Karen. She is
distraught. She looks at Nic, wild and scared at the same
time.

Close on Karen: what now? She jumps in the car, starts the
engine.

JASPER
(from inside)
Mom?

===

Karen simply gestures again - Stay there! - as she reverses
it onto the street, takes off, disappears. It's wild and loud
and scary.

CUT TO:

Back to David, who is walking back - out of breath - and now
sees Karen in the car speeding off, going after Nic...

DAVID
No! No!

David loses it, everything just seems to slip out of his
hands.

**I/E. MAZDA / STREETS OF INVERNESS - DAY**

Nic driving, looking behind him. And then there's Karen in
the distance gaining ground.

NIC
Ah, no!

He floors it.

Nic turns a corner. Karen not far behind it.

**I/E. MAZDA / STREETS AROUND INVERNESS - DAY**

On a stretch of Marin County road, Nic powers along.

LAUREN
(looking behind)
I think we're losing her...

Karen way back there.

**I/E. CAR, STREETS AROUND INVERNESS - DAY**

Karen is slowing down. Suddenly realizing this is crazy. She
comes to a stop in the middle of the road.

She watches the Mazda ahead in the distance. Stares blankly.
Motionless.

And suddenly: she's weeping. It all comes out, floods of
tears, huge gulping sobs.

===

**EXT. DRIVEWAY, SHEFF HOUSE - DAY**

David walks up to the driveway. Daisy is crying.
Jasper is consoling her.

DAVID
I'm sorry guys.

David looks at them... doesn't know what to do anymore. He
comes closer to his kids. Sits on the ground near them.

DAVID (CONT'D)
I'm so sorry.

**EXT. PORTRERO HILL, SF - NIGHT**

Nic is taking a walk and smoking a cigarette by himself. He
drops the butt and walks over to his Mazda on a quiet street
on a hill. In the distance we see the city of San Francisco.

**INT. MAZDA - NIGHT**

Nic steps into his Mazda. As the light turns on, we see
Lauren is lying in the passenger seat, passed out.

Nic watches her a little closer, is she OK? He shakes her.

NIC
Lauren?

She actually looks a little blue.

NIC (CONT'D)
Lauren?!

He checks a pulse. None. He slaps her face.

NIC (CONT'D)
Lauren!

He panics, searches her phone, finds it, dials 911. Meanwhile
tilts the backseat, and starts to do some CPR. Mouth to
mouth. Chest compressions.

NIC (CONT'D)
(in phone)
Hello. Yeah, I'm with a friend. She
just OD'd. I need an ambulance. We
need some help!

===

911 VOICE (O.S.)
Sir, do you know CPR?

NIC
I'm doing it. Please come quick.
You have to send an ambulance.

911 VOICE (O.S.)
What is your location?

NIC
I don't know. Trace the call.

Nic drops the phone, keeps on doing chest compressions. All
of a sudden:

Lauren gasps, and jerks awake. She blinks twice and bursts
into tears.

Nic is relieved. He holds her.

**EXT. PORTRERO HILL, SF - NIGHT**

An ambulance has now arrived and routine examinations have
been done.

EMT
We need to take you to the ER.

LAUREN
I don't want to. I'm fine.

EMT
(firm)
We need to take you to the ER.

NIC
Can't you hear what she's saying?
She doesn't want to go.

EMT
Otherwise I need to inform the
police. Up to you.

NIC
Godammit.

Nic and Lauren look at each other. They don't want police.

LAUREN
You're going to come meet me right?
You promise?

===

NIC
Yes.

Nic nods. Lauren is crying.

LAUREN
I love you. Come get me, Nic.

NIC
I love you too.

LAUREN
Please come get me. You promise?

Nic gets angry.

NIC
Yes I said I will! What do you
fucking want from me?

Nic can't look Lauren in the eyes. This is the end, but
Lauren is too fucked up to see that.

CUT TO:

The ambulance drives off. Nic feels miserable. Worn out,
fucked up, done. Nic still has Lauren's phone. He dials a
number. It's ringing.

DAVID (O.S.)
David Sheff...

NIC
Hey dad. It's me.

DAVID (O.S.)
Nic.

Nic is crying. Standing in the middle of the street.

NIC
Please don't hate me, dad. I know
what I did wrong. I... Listen, I
want to stop. But please, please,
please no rehab. Let me come home.
I realized I actually need to be
home. You guys will give me the
strength to stop. Alright?

A beat.

DAVID (O.S.)
That's not going to happen.

===

**INTERCUT WITH INT. LIVING ROOM, SHEFF HOUSE - NIGHT**

David is seated on the edge of the couch.

This breaks David's heart.

DAVID
I wish I could help, but I can't do
that. I can't.

NIC
Please help me dad. I just need a
little bit of help.
(crying, pleading)
Please help me. I want to come
home.

DAVID
All I can tell you is what you
already know. Call your sponsor.

NIC
I don't want to talk to my sponsor.
I want to talk to you.

DAVID
Get help. I love you and I hope you
get your life together.

NIC
I love you too.

David hangs up.

We stay on David's face for a while.

**EXT. PORTRERO HILL, SF - NIGHT**

Nic looks out at the city. Alone.

**INT. DAVID'S STUDY, SHEFF HOUSE - NIGHT**

David enters his study. It's a mess, papers everywhere.
Books, printouts, etc. He starts cleaning up his desk. Makes
it all neat and tidy.

He looks around and watches the pictures hanging on the wall.
We've seen them a couple of times now. David walks to the
wall.

Looks at the picture of him and Nic, 12 years old, both in
wetsuits.

===

He takes it down. He then takes down a couple of other
pictures with Nic in them too. He steps to his desk, opens a
lower-down desk drawer. He puts the photos in there. He
closes the drawer.

He walks out and switches the light off.

**EXT. BEAR VALLEY TRAIL, ARCH ROCK - DAY**

David, Karen, Daisy and Jasper together with ANOTHER FAMILY
WITH KIDS are walking over the Bear Valley Trail.

They arrive near the ocean. It's really beautiful. Daisy,
Jasper and the other kids are playing pretty wild, running
and jumping. As they arrive closer to the edge of the cliffs
Karen is a little worried about it, but she let's them be.
David too.

David's phone buzzes. Caller ID says 'Vicki'.

David distances himself a little from the rest of the gang
and takes the call.

**INTERCUT WITH INT. HOUSE VICKI LA - DAY**

DAVID
Hello?

VICKI
Nicolas called. He sounds
desperate. He is going to die if we
don't do anything.

David takes a deep breath.

DAVID
And he's going to die even if we
do. Nothing we do has any
effect on him.

A beat. Karen looks back at David.

DAVID (CONT'D)
I failed.

VICKI
I know you feel ashamed. OK? So do
I.

Silence.

===

Vicki takes a deep breath and starts talking, takes her time
to make her point.

VICKI (CONT'D)
But you have done great, David.
And Karen too. So thank you for
that. You were up for it, when I
wasn't. And I'm not giving up now.
Never. But I can't do this alone. I
need your help.

David thinks about it. It hurts.

DAVID
I don't think you can save people,
Vicki.

A beat.

VICKI
No, but you can be there for them.
Can't you?

David let's it sink in, breathes heavily. He watches Karen
and the other couple. He watches the cliffs and the rocks and
the ocean.

DAVID
I'm done. OK?

Vicki is crying. Crushed. She hangs up.

**INT. CAFFE TRIESTE - DUSK**

Nic sits in Caffe Trieste, again. He is writing some stuff in
a notebook. His eyes look like he has cried for hours.

**INT. AL-ANON MEETING, CHURCH BASEMENT - NIGHT**

David and Karen enter a dingy room. Neon tubes flicker, a fan
is ticking in a corner. A dozen people are there, serving
themselves coffee and donuts.

The meeting is called to order, people take seats in plastic
chairs set in a circle. David and Karen too.

We see people talking, but don't hear them. David and Karen
are listening while also checking out the people. What to
think of this? Do they belong there?

===

David reads an AL ANON sign that reads the AL ANON THREE C's:
'You didn't cause it, you can't cure it, you can't control
it.'

CUT TO:

Mid-meeting.

MEETING LEADER
Rose, would you like to share?

A woman, clearly distraught, sits up straighter in her seat.

ROSE
Thank you. I'm Rose.

THE GROUP
Hi, Rose.

ROSE
I, well... I had a rough week. Some
of you know, some of you don't. I
lost my Frances this week -

a real gasp of dismay in the room -

ROSE (CONT'D)
- she died of an overdose on
Sunday.

She herself alternates between being very matter-of-fact and
having great trouble holding it together.

ROSE (CONT'D)
I guess that means I'm in mourning.
But I realized something else. I've
actually been in mourning for
years. Cos even when she was alive,
she wasn't there.

Her friends continue to stroke her. Some PEOPLE are in tears.
David is listening but not looking. Karen closes her eyes.

INTERCUT WITH:

**INT. CAFFE TRIESTE - NIGHT**

Nic stops writing, gets up and walks to the bathroom. He
leaves his notebook on the table.

===

**INT. AL-ANON MEETING, CHURCH BASEMENT - NIGHT**

Rose continues.

ROSE
You mourn for the living. That's a
hard way to live. So in a way, it's
better, I guess. She was a dear,
dear young woman. I always felt I
needed to stay strong. There'd be
some future event, and I'd need all
my strength for it. But there are
no events after this one. I hope
she's not in pain now. Oh, my
Frances.

And now Rose weeps, and weeps. It's a full-fledged weeping,
the kind you don't often see, even in meetings. But the room
just lets it happen. Lets it flow. Lets her be.

David takes Karen's hand. Karen let's it happen. She's cried,
she doesn't look at David.

**INT. CAFFE TRIESTE**

Nic's injecting himself in the bathroom.

As it comes on it's not slow motion, but it might as well be.

Nic, jaws slack, eyes closed, unfurls backwards in his own
SLOW-MO. In a beautiful, haunted arc of ballet he fully
reclines, until his head slowly touches the ground as if it's
a feather-down mattress. PEACE descends. His lips are turning
blue.

**INT. CAR / WINDING ROADS INVERNESS - DAWN**

David is driving the winding roads. As he drives through the
woods it's pretty dark outside. Focusing on the road, he
looks blank-faced. Frozen. Conflicted.

As he takes a turn, and exits the woods, he arrives in an
open valley, where the sun manages to shine its first rays of
light. He watches the gentle hills of Marin.

**INT. HALLWAY, RECOVERY HOUSE - DAY**

David walks into a white hallway.

===

**INT. WAITING ROOM, RECOVERY HOUSE - DAY**

David sees Vicki sitting in a chair.


DAVID
Hey.

VICKI
Hi.

They hug. Holding on for an extra beat before letting go.

DAVID
How is he doing?

VICKI
The doctor is with him right now.

She chuckles.

VICKI (CONT'D)
He said it's close to a miracle
that Nic survived, with all the
drugs in his body.

David breathes deep in, and out again. Looks at Vicki. Takes
her hand and holds it for a moment.

**INT. CORRIDOR, RECOVERY HOUSE - DAY**

David supports Nic under one arm as they trundle along a
corridor.

Nic holding onto David with one arm. From behind, it looks
like the way a younger man would support his frail, doddering
father. But it's the opposite.

EXT. COURTYARD - DAY
David and Nic sit on plastic chairs in a nondescript empty
inner courtyard with a view onto the back of a blank wall
that's evidently not been painted in twenty years.

Side-by-side, looking at the small pebbled courtyard with its
sickly potted palms.

They look at each other. Nic tries to smile. But starts
crying. A little later David too. David hugs Nic.

FADE TO BLACK.

===

CARDS:

Drug overdoses are now the leading cause of death for
Americans under 50.

Through an incredible amount of support and hard work, Nic
has been sober for 8 years - one day at a time.

While addiction treatment is massively under-funded and underregulated, there are those working tirelessly in all
communities to combat this epidemic.

The help is out there - for those struggling with the
disease, their loved ones, and for those who grieve.

ROLL CREDITS.
